We can give the name in a form that is always going to be the same, regardless of what we have done before, like this:\n\n   ~/sd\n\nIn this pathname, we are using the ~ to represent the (absolute) path to the home directory, and then, within that, we are referring to the sd subdirectory.  Some other examples of absolute pathnames would be:\n\n  ~/sd/hw01/daily.cpp\n  ~/cs2\n  /usr/local/cs/cs251\n\nAnything that starts with ~ or / will be an absolute pathname.\n\nOn the other hand, we can also specify relative path names, that is, names that are relative to our current location in the file system.  Say for example that, when we first logged in, we want to go to our hw01 directory, like this (using an absolute pathname):\n\n  cd ~/sd/hw01\n\nIf we wanted to go to the hw02 directory, we could do so with a relative pathname like this:\n\n  cd ../hw02\n\nThe .. means the parent directory, which, in this case, is the sd directory, and the hw02 subdirectory is assumed to be inside it.  From there, if we wanted to go to the cs2 directory, we could use another relative pathname, like this:\n\n  cd ../../cs2\n\nIn this case, the parent of the parent of the current directory is the home directory, and the cs2 directory is found within it.\n\nIf we say something like:\n\n  cd sd\n\nThen that is a relative pathname, so it will only work if we are already in a directory that has a subdirectory named sd.  So if we are in the home directory, the command \"cd sd\" will work fine, but otherwise not.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

The main objective of linear programming is to maximize or minimize the numerical value. It consists of linear functions which are subjected to the constraints in the form of linear equations or in the form of inequalities. Linear programming is considered an important technique that is used to find the optimum resource utilization. The term \u201clinear programming\u201d consists of two words: linear and programming.

This is useful when the size of an array is not known before the execution of a program. \n\nThe new operator is a unary operator used to dynamically allocate a block of memory and keep its address in a pointer variable at some point during the execution of a program. In other words, this operator is like a request for memory allocation on the heap memory (or the free store). And if sufficient memory is available, the dynamic space is initialized to the newly created variable or pointer.\n\nWhat happens once we do not need the variable that we've got declared dynamically? Well, we must deallocate the space in memory occupied by means of the variable.\nFor this, we use the delete operator and deallocate the block of memory that was dynamically allotted with the use of the new operator. In view of that, a programmer must de-allocate a block of memory, as soon as it is not required within the program or code or it will lead to memory leaks/segmentation faults. So, we require the delete operator to avoid memory leaks (i.e. segmentation faults). \n\nFor every use of the \u201cnew\u201d keyword there should be a use of the \u201cdelete\u201d keyword.\n\nThe new operator is a unary operator used to dynamically allocate a block of memory and keep its address in a pointer variable at some point during the execution of a program.

Another reason to use a link machine is that they come preinstalled with all the correct software and compilers you would need to use for your course. For instance, not all personal computers come with the C/C++ compiler preinstalled which would make compiling Data Structures homework a lot harder. Finally, the link machines use the Linux operating system which is widely regarded as the best operating system for software engineering.<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Whenever you get a segfault you know you are doing something wrong with memory \u2013 accessing a variable that has already been freed, writing to a read-only portion of the memory, etc.\n\nA few common ways to get a segmentation fault is to dereference a null pointer, try to write to a portion of the memory marked as read-only (i.e. using char or const in the pointer declaration), use dangling pointers, meaning a pointer points to something that no longer exists (this usually happens when pointers are declared and used in different scopes), or improperly allocate and free dynamic memory.\n\nHere is a list of steps to take to try and resolve a segmentation fault:\n\n1. Check that you are not trying to modify a string literal. This means you are trying to modify a string that was declared using char, making it read only. If this is the case, either remove char from the declaration or do not attempt to modify the string.\n\n2. Check if you are trying to access an address that has been freed. For instance, if you have allocated something in dynamic memory and then deleted it, you cannot try to access it again. Similarly, if you are using dynamic memory and have forgotten to call delete once you are done with it, this can also cause a segmentation fault.\n\n3. Are you accessing an out-of-bounds array index? In C and C++, there is no array bounds checking, so if you have an array of four items and try to access an element at position 6, a segmentation fault can occur. Many times a program tries to access an element in an array that is just beyond the bounds of an array, usually due to an error in a loop declaration.\n\n4. It may be due to stack overflow. While this is not a common problem, this can occur if you run out of memory in your stack. It is also a type of memory corruption that may happen due to large array size, a large number of recursive calls, lots of local variables, etc. This segmentation fault may be raised even if you don\u2019t have any pointers in your code.\n\n5. You may also receive a segmentation fault due to buffer overflows. If the data being stored in the buffer is larger than the allocated size of the buffer, a buffer overflow occurs which leads to the segmentation fault. Most of the methods in the C language do not perform bound checking, so buffer overflow happens frequently when we forget to allot the required size to the buffer.\n\n6. If you try to dereference a null or uninitialized pointer you will also get a segmentation fault.\n\n7. If using dynamic memory, remember that for every new call there should be a corresponding delete call!<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Every computer has an internal hard drive, but you can also get external hard drives that can be used to expand the storage of a computer. \n\nSSDs (solid state drives) are the newer of the type of hard drive. They have become the preferred format for high-end laptops\u2019 internal hard drives, and all smartphones and tablets also use a form of SSD.\n\nSolid-state drives use flash memory, which is also what\u2019s used in USB flash drives and memory cards for digital cameras. There are no magnets involved here, SSDs use semiconductors that store data by altering the electrical state of the trillions of circuits contained within the SSD. Because they have no moving parts, not only do they work faster (as you don\u2019t need to wait for disks to spin and heads to gather information), they also tend to last longer than HDDs.\n\nSDDs are a lot more expensive to manufacture, so while they\u2019re increasingly prevalent as the primary disk drive for high-end laptops and PCs, hard disk drives are still preferred by many as a cheaper external option.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Sometimes it\u2019s called PC memory or just memory. In essence, RAM is your computer or laptop\u2019s short-term memory. It\u2019s where the data is stored that your computer processor needs to run your applications and open your files.\n\nInside your computer, RAM typically comes in the form of a rectangular flat circuit board with memory chips attached, also referred to as a memory module. Computers typically come with at least two RAM modules with room to add more, if needed. These RAM modules are critical components that work hand in hand with your computer\u2019s central processing unit (CPU) and must be working optimally for you to have a good experience.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Every major corporation uses it, in every data center.\n\nSSH keys enable the automation that makes modern cloud services and other computer-dependent services possible and cost-effective. They offer convenience and improved security when properly managed.\n\nFunctionally SSH keys resemble passwords. They grant access and control who can access what. In identity and access management, they need similar policies, provisioning, and termination as user accounts and passwords. One cannot have confidentiality, integrity, or any guarantees of continued availability of systems without controlling SSH keys.\n\nTechnically the keys are cryptographic keys using a public key cryptosystem. However, functionally they are authentication credentials and need to be managed as such.<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Every computer has an internal hard drive, but you can also get external hard drives that can be used to expand the storage of a computer. \n\nSSDs (solid state drives) are the newer of the type of hard drive. They have become the preferred format for high-end laptops\u2019 internal hard drives, and all smartphones and tablets also use a form of SSD.\n\nSolid-state drives use flash memory, which is also what\u2019s used in USB flash drives and memory cards for digital cameras. There are no magnets involved here, SSDs use semiconductors that store data by altering the electrical state of the trillions of circuits contained within the SSD. Because they have no moving parts, not only do they work faster (as you don\u2019t need to wait for disks to spin and heads to gather information), they also tend to last longer than HDDs.\n\nSDDs are a lot more expensive to manufacture, so while they\u2019re increasingly prevalent as the primary disk drive for high-end laptops and PCs, hard disk drives are still preferred by many as a cheaper external option.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

We can give the name in a form that is always going to be the same, regardless of what we have done before, like this:\n\n   ~/sd\n\nIn this pathname, we are using the ~ to represent the (absolute) path to the home directory, and then, within that, we are referring to the sd subdirectory.  Some other examples of absolute pathnames would be:\n\n  ~/sd/hw01/daily.cpp\n  ~/cs2\n  /usr/local/cs/cs251\n\nAnything that starts with ~ or / will be an absolute pathname.\n\nOn the other hand, we can also specify relative path names, that is, names that are relative to our current location in the file system.  Say for example that, when we first logged in, we want to go to our hw01 directory, like this (using an absolute pathname):\n\n  cd ~/sd/hw01\n\nIf we wanted to go to the hw02 directory, we could do so with a relative pathname like this:\n\n  cd ../hw02\n\nThe .. means the parent directory, which, in this case, is the sd directory, and the hw02 subdirectory is assumed to be inside it.  From there, if we wanted to go to the cs2 directory, we could use another relative pathname, like this:\n\n  cd ../../cs2\n\nIn this case, the parent of the parent of the current directory is the home directory, and the cs2 directory is found within it.\n\nIf we say something like:\n\n  cd sd\n\nThen that is a relative pathname, so it will only work if we are already in a directory that has a subdirectory named sd.  So if we are in the home directory, the command \"cd sd\" will work fine, but otherwise not.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

You must resolve this merge conflict with a new commit before you can merge these branches.\n\n1. Open Terminal.\n\n2. Navigate into the local Git repository that has the merge conflict.\n\n3. Generate a list of the files affected by the merge conflict using the command git status\n\n4. Open your favorite text editor, such as Visual Studio Code, and navigate to the file that has merge conflicts.\n\n5. To see the beginning of the merge conflict in your file, search the file for the conflict marker <<<<<<<. When you open the file in your text editor, you'll see the changes from the HEAD or base branch after the line <<<<<<< HEAD. Next, you'll see =======, which divides your changes from the changes in the other branch, followed by >>>>>>> BRANCH-NAME. In this example, one person wrote \"open an issue\" in the base or HEAD branch and another person wrote \"ask your question in IRC\" in the compare branch or branch-a.\n\nIf you have questions, please\n<<<<<<< HEAD\nopen an issue\n=======\nask your question in IRC.\n>>>>>>> branch-a\n\n6. Decide if you want to keep only your branch's changes, keep only the other branch's changes, or make a brand new change, which may incorporate changes from both branches. Delete the conflict markers <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>> and make the changes you want in the final merge. In this example, both changes are incorporated into the final merge:\n\n7. Add and commit your new file!\n\n\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

To start, open VSCode, and on the left side of the window open the extensions tab (the icon with four squares at the end of the list of icons).\n\nIn the search bar that appears in the extensions tab, search for \u201cssh.\u201d Select \u201cRemote - SSH\u201d when it appears (it should be near the top and is created by Microsoft).\n\nInstall the extension, and follow any instructions during the installation process. Once it has been installed, quit and relaunch VSCode (just to make sure everything is configured correctly). You should now see a new icon above the extensions icon that has a screen with arrows in a circle. Select that icon. It will bring up the remote explorer tab (the icon looks like a computer with greater than and less than signs in the bottom right corner).\n\nIn the remote explorer tab, make sure SSH Targets is selected in the top dropdown menu and you see the SSH Targets list underneath. To add an SSH connection, hover over the SSH Targets list header, and then click the plus that appears to the right of that heading.\n\nIn the prompt that appears, type:\n\nssh username@rns20x-y.cs.stolaf.edu\n\nwhere you replace username with your St. Olaf username, x with either 2 or 3 (for RNS 202 and 203), and y with a number in the range 1-27. These correspond to each link machine in RNS 202 and 203. Then hit enter. \n\nIn the next screen that appears, just press enter again, you want to update your default SSH configuration profile.\n\nAfter you have done that, you will see the host added in the remote explorer tab under SSH Targets.\n\nNext, hover over the name of the host and you will see a little button appear to the right of the name that looks like a window with a plus. Click that button.\n\nA new window will pop up. You may receive a prompt asking you to select the platform of the remote host. If so, select Linux. Also, if this is the first time you are connecting to the host, you will receive a prompt talking about a fingerprint. Select Continue. \n\nIt will then ask you for your password (this is your St. Olaf password). \n\nOnce you have entered your password, you can tell if you are connected to the link machine by looking in the bottom left corner and verifying that the name of the link machine is listed there.\n\n\nIf at any point you get a connection refused error, try the following steps:\n\nCheck if your machine\u2019s SSH service is down. You can do that by entering the following sudo service status ssh If the command line returns that the ssh service is down, that is most likely your error. To solve it, research how to enable SSH on Mac/Windows/Linux depending on the operating system your personal computer is running. \n\nYou may be using the wrong credentials. Double check that the hostname, your username and your password are all typed correctly. For connecting to link machines, the hostname should follow the form: \n\nrns20[2-3]-[1-20].cs.stolaf.edu \n\nwhere in each set of brackets you pick a number in the range and then omit the brackets from the hostname.\n\nIf the above steps do not work, try the following. On your personal machine, enter the following command: \n\nssh -Q mac \n\nA list will print. One potential output looks something like: hmac-sha1. Next, instead of running the standard ssh command, run this command instead, using the first entry in the list you just generated: \n\nssh -m [first entry from list] username@rns20[2-3]-[1-20].cs.stolaf.edu \n\nWhere everything in brackets is replaced and the brackets are not included in the command. Repeat the above command with other entries in the list you generated until one of them works. To try with hmac-sha1 on the rns202-1 link machine, the command would be:\n\nssh -m hmac-sha1 username@rns202-1.cs.stolaf.edu\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. To do this, a stack is used. All the adjacent unvisited nodes are pushed into the stack.<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug\u2014no matter how big or how small\u2014you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes. This is especially useful when working on projects with multiple people because it allows you to avoid merge conflicts. If multiple people are working on main and make different changes to a file, a merge conflict arises. However, if multiple people are working on the same file but on different branches, no merge conflict arises.<end_of_turn><eos>"}

The first step is to add your files to be committed. You can do this by entering the following command:\n\ngit add [filenames, separated by spaces] \n\nThen, you need to commit your files by entering the following command:\n\ngit commit -m \u201csome message\u201d\n\nMake sure to include a commit message in quotations after the -m. This message should be related to the files you are changing, such as \u201cupdated file1\u201d or \u201chw01 submission.\u201d\n\nNext, make sure the link machine/your personal computer is up to date with the repository by pulling from the repository. You can do this by running the following command:\n\ngit pull origin main\n\nIf you are working with a different git branch, you can use git pull origin [branch].\n\nIf that command is successful, then you can push to git using the following command:\n\ngit push origin main\n\nAgain, if you are using a branch, you can replace main with the branch name.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Every computer has an internal hard drive, but you can also get external hard drives that can be used to expand the storage of a computer. \n\nSSDs (solid state drives) are the newer of the type of hard drive. They have become the preferred format for high-end laptops\u2019 internal hard drives, and all smartphones and tablets also use a form of SSD.\n\nSolid-state drives use flash memory, which is also what\u2019s used in USB flash drives and memory cards for digital cameras. There are no magnets involved here, SSDs use semiconductors that store data by altering the electrical state of the trillions of circuits contained within the SSD. Because they have no moving parts, not only do they work faster (as you don\u2019t need to wait for disks to spin and heads to gather information), they also tend to last longer than HDDs.\n\nSDDs are a lot more expensive to manufacture, so while they\u2019re increasingly prevalent as the primary disk drive for high-end laptops and PCs, hard disk drives are still preferred by many as a cheaper external option.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

We group the \"inheritance concept\" into two categories:\n\nderived class (child) - the class that inherits from another class\nbase class (parent) - the class being inherited from\n\nUsually inheritance is used if one class is a type of another class. For instance, if there is a Rectangle class and a Square class to represent rectangles and squares, since a square is a rectangle, it would make sense for the Square class to inherit the Rectangle class since they share some properties!\n\nInheritance is also used if there is a base class with methods and variables that are used by many classes but then the derived classes have some specific methods and variables unique to them. This saves code writing time since you only need to write common methods and variables once in the base class!\n\nTo inherit from a class, use the : symbol. For example, if I have a class Vehicle and I want the class Car to inherit from the class vehicle, I would define the classes as follows:\n\nclass Vehicle { \u2026 }\n\nclass Car : public Vehicle { \u2026 }\n\nThere are many useful applications of inheritance, and inheritance is one of the key elements of object oriented programming! \n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

To start, open VSCode, and on the left side of the window open the extensions tab (the icon with four squares at the end of the list of icons).\n\nIn the search bar that appears in the extensions tab, search for \u201cssh.\u201d Select \u201cRemote - SSH\u201d when it appears (it should be near the top and is created by Microsoft).\n\nInstall the extension, and follow any instructions during the installation process. Once it has been installed, quit and relaunch VSCode (just to make sure everything is configured correctly). You should now see a new icon above the extensions icon that has a screen with arrows in a circle. Select that icon. It will bring up the remote explorer tab (the icon looks like a computer with greater than and less than signs in the bottom right corner).\n\nIn the remote explorer tab, make sure SSH Targets is selected in the top dropdown menu and you see the SSH Targets list underneath. To add an SSH connection, hover over the SSH Targets list header, and then click the plus that appears to the right of that heading.\n\nIn the prompt that appears, type:\n\nssh username@rns20x-y.cs.stolaf.edu\n\nwhere you replace username with your St. Olaf username, x with either 2 or 3 (for RNS 202 and 203), and y with a number in the range 1-27. These correspond to each link machine in RNS 202 and 203. Then hit enter. \n\nIn the next screen that appears, just press enter again, you want to update your default SSH configuration profile.\n\nAfter you have done that, you will see the host added in the remote explorer tab under SSH Targets.\n\nNext, hover over the name of the host and you will see a little button appear to the right of the name that looks like a window with a plus. Click that button.\n\nA new window will pop up. You may receive a prompt asking you to select the platform of the remote host. If so, select Linux. Also, if this is the first time you are connecting to the host, you will receive a prompt talking about a fingerprint. Select Continue. \n\nIt will then ask you for your password (this is your St. Olaf password). \n\nOnce you have entered your password, you can tell if you are connected to the link machine by looking in the bottom left corner and verifying that the name of the link machine is listed there.\n\n\nIf at any point you get a connection refused error, try the following steps:\n\nCheck if your machine\u2019s SSH service is down. You can do that by entering the following sudo service status ssh If the command line returns that the ssh service is down, that is most likely your error. To solve it, research how to enable SSH on Mac/Windows/Linux depending on the operating system your personal computer is running. \n\nYou may be using the wrong credentials. Double check that the hostname, your username and your password are all typed correctly. For connecting to link machines, the hostname should follow the form: \n\nrns20[2-3]-[1-20].cs.stolaf.edu \n\nwhere in each set of brackets you pick a number in the range and then omit the brackets from the hostname.\n\nIf the above steps do not work, try the following. On your personal machine, enter the following command: \n\nssh -Q mac \n\nA list will print. One potential output looks something like: hmac-sha1. Next, instead of running the standard ssh command, run this command instead, using the first entry in the list you just generated: \n\nssh -m [first entry from list] username@rns20[2-3]-[1-20].cs.stolaf.edu \n\nWhere everything in brackets is replaced and the brackets are not included in the command. Repeat the above command with other entries in the list you generated until one of them works. To try with hmac-sha1 on the rns202-1 link machine, the command would be:\n\nssh -m hmac-sha1 username@rns202-1.cs.stolaf.edu\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

They have become the preferred format for high-end laptops\u2019 internal hard drives, and all smartphones and tablets also use a form of SSD.\n\nSolid-state drives use flash memory, which is also what\u2019s used in USB flash drives and memory cards for digital cameras. There are no magnets involved here, SSDs use semiconductors that store data by altering the electrical state of the trillions of circuits contained within the SSD. Because they have no moving parts, not only do they work faster (as you don\u2019t need to wait for disks to spin and heads to gather information), they also tend to last longer than HDDs.\n\nSDDs are a lot more expensive to manufacture, so while they\u2019re increasingly prevalent as the primary disk drive for high-end laptops and PCs, hard disk drives are still preferred by many as a cheaper external option.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

It is used to access the public members of a class, structure, or members of a union with the help of a pointer variable.\n\nThere is a .(dot) operator in C++ that is also used to access the members of a class. But .(dot operator) accesses the member or variable directly without using the pointers whereas instead of accessing members directly the arrow operator(->) in C++ uses a pointer to access them. So the advantage of the -> operator is that it can deal with both pointer and non-pointer access but the dot(.) operator can only be used to access the members of a class.\n\nArrow (->) operator in C++ represents the same meaning which is done by the (*) asterisk operator and dot(.) operator. Arrow operator can be written in a different way which is using the combination of two operators *.. For example, (*s).element is the same as s->element. The brackets (parenthesis) used while using the combination of (*.) operators show that the precedence of the dot(.) operator is more than *.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}
