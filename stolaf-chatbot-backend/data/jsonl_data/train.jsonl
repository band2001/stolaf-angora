The 'c' in cout stands for character, and 'out' stands for output. Thus cout refers to character output. We use the insertion operator along with cout to output formatted data. cout in C++ is defined in the iostream header file. To use cout, we must include namespace std in our program. Without it, we would have to write std::cout instead of cout in our code. In this article, we will cover cout in further detail. The syntax is:\n\n#include<iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\ncout << [variable to print]\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

This is useful when the size of an array is not known before the execution of a program. \n\nThe new operator is a unary operator used to dynamically allocate a block of memory and keep its address in a pointer variable at some point during the execution of a program. In other words, this operator is like a request for memory allocation on the heap memory (or the free store). And if sufficient memory is available, the dynamic space is initialized to the newly created variable or pointer.\n\nWhat happens once we do not need the variable that we've got declared dynamically? Well, we must deallocate the space in memory occupied by means of the variable.\nFor this, we use the delete operator and deallocate the block of memory that was dynamically allotted with the use of the new operator. In view of that, a programmer must de-allocate a block of memory, as soon as it is not required within the program or code or it will lead to memory leaks/segmentation faults. So, we require the delete operator to avoid memory leaks (i.e. segmentation faults). \n\nFor every use of the \u201cnew\u201d keyword there should be a use of the \u201cdelete\u201d keyword.\n\nThe new operator is a unary operator used to dynamically allocate a block of memory and keep its address in a pointer variable at some point during the execution of a program.

For basic linking, you can just include multiple files in the g++ compile command like this:\n\ng++ foo1.cpp foo2.cpp\n\nThis produces an executable file a.out where you can use ./a.out to run it. However, we generally use the following method for linking more files as it means a change in one file does not mean every file needs to be recompiled. To do this, you create .o files for each cpp/header file and then link them together. An example is shown here: \n\ng++ -c foo1.cpp\ng++ -c foo2.cpp\ng++ -o foo foo1.o foo2.o\n\nThis produces an executable file foo where you use ./foo to run it. If you made a change to foo2.cpp, you would only need to rerun:\n\ng++ -c foo2.cpp\ng++ -o foo foo1.o foo2.o\n\nsince no changes were made to foo1.cpp so foo1.o remains the same.\n\ng++ foo1.cpp foo2.cpp\n\nThis produces an executable file a.out where you can use ./a.out to run it. For more advanced linking, i.e. to create .o files for each cpp/header file and then link them together, you can use the following command:\n\ng++ -c foo1.cpp\ng++ -c foo2.cpp\ng++ -o foo foo1.o foo2.o\n\nThis produces an executable file foo where you use ./foo to run it.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

It was conceived by Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956.\n\nThe algorithm maintains a set of visited vertices and a set of unvisited vertices. It starts at the source vertex and iteratively selects the unvisited vertex with the smallest tentative distance from the source. It then visits the neighbors of this vertex and updates their tentative distances if a shorter path is found. This process continues until the destination vertex is reached, or all reachable vertices have been visited.\n\nThe need for Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm arises in many applications where finding the shortest path between two points is crucial.\n\nFor example, It can be used in the routing protocols for computer networks and also used by map systems to find the shortest path between starting point and the Destination (as explained in How does Google Maps work?).\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

It was conceived by Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956.\n\nThe algorithm maintains a set of visited vertices and a set of unvisited vertices. It starts at the source vertex and iteratively selects the unvisited vertex with the smallest tentative distance from the source. It then visits the neighbors of this vertex and updates their tentative distances if a shorter path is found. This process continues until the destination vertex is reached, or all reachable vertices have been visited.\n\nThe need for Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm arises in many applications where finding the shortest path between two points is crucial.\n\nFor example, It can be used in the routing protocols for computer networks and also used by map systems to find the shortest path between starting point and the Destination (as explained in How does Google Maps work?).\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Every computer has an internal hard drive, but you can also get external hard drives that can be used to expand the storage of a computer. \n\nSSDs (solid state drives) are the newer of the type of hard drive. They have become the preferred format for high-end laptops\u2019 internal hard drives, and all smartphones and tablets also use a form of SSD.\n\nSolid-state drives use flash memory, which is also what\u2019s used in USB flash drives and memory cards for digital cameras. There are no magnets involved here, SSDs use semiconductors that store data by altering the electrical state of the trillions of circuits contained within the SSD. Because they have no moving parts, not only do they work faster (as you don\u2019t need to wait for disks to spin and heads to gather information), they also tend to last longer than HDDs.\n\nSDDs are a lot more expensive to manufacture, so while they\u2019re increasingly prevalent as the primary disk drive for high-end laptops and PCs, hard disk drives are still preferred by many as a cheaper external option.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Every computer has an internal hard drive, but you can also get external hard drives that can be used to expand the storage of a computer. \n\nSSDs (solid state drives) are the newer of the type of hard drive. They have become the preferred format for high-end laptops\u2019 internal hard drives, and all smartphones and tablets also use a form of SSD.\n\nSolid-state drives use flash memory, which is also what\u2019s used in USB flash drives and memory cards for digital cameras. There are no magnets involved here, SSDs use semiconductors that store data by altering the electrical state of the trillions of circuits contained within the SSD. Because they have no moving parts, not only do they work faster (as you don\u2019t need to wait for disks to spin and heads to gather information), they also tend to last longer than HDDs.\n\nSDDs are a lot more expensive to manufacture, so while they\u2019re increasingly prevalent as the primary disk drive for high-end laptops and PCs, hard disk drives are still preferred by many as a cheaper external option.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

It is used to access the public members of a class, structure, or members of a union with the help of a pointer variable.\n\nThere is a .(dot) operator in C++ that is also used to access the members of a class. But .(dot operator) accesses the member or variable directly without using the pointers whereas instead of accessing members directly the arrow operator(->) in C++ uses a pointer to access them. So the advantage of the -> operator is that it can deal with both pointer and non-pointer access but the dot(.) operator can only be used to access the members of a class.\n\nArrow (->) operator in C++ represents the same meaning which is done by the (*) asterisk operator and dot(.) operator. Arrow operator can be written in a different way which is using the combination of two operators *.. For example, (*s).element is the same as s->element. The brackets (parenthesis) used while using the combination of (*.) operators show that the precedence of the dot(.) operator is more than *.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

You must resolve this merge conflict with a new commit before you can merge these branches.\n\n1. Open Terminal.\n\n2. Navigate into the local Git repository that has the merge conflict.\n\n3. Generate a list of the files affected by the merge conflict using the command git status\n\n4. Open your favorite text editor, such as Visual Studio Code, and navigate to the file that has merge conflicts.\n\n5. To see the beginning of the merge conflict in your file, search the file for the conflict marker <<<<<<<. When you open the file in your text editor, you'll see the changes from the HEAD or base branch after the line <<<<<<< HEAD. Next, you'll see =======, which divides your changes from the changes in the other branch, followed by >>>>>>> BRANCH-NAME. In this example, one person wrote \"open an issue\" in the base or HEAD branch and another person wrote \"ask your question in IRC\" in the compare branch or branch-a.\n\nIf you have questions, please\n<<<<<<< HEAD\nopen an issue\n=======\nask your question in IRC.\n>>>>>>> branch-a\n\n6. Decide if you want to keep only your branch's changes, keep only the other branch's changes, or make a brand new change, which may incorporate changes from both branches. Delete the conflict markers <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>> and make the changes you want in the final merge. In this example, both changes are incorporated into the final merge:\n\n7. Add and commit your new file!\n\n\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

We group the \"inheritance concept\" into two categories:\n\nderived class (child) - the class that inherits from another class\nbase class (parent) - the class being inherited from\n\nUsually inheritance is used if one class is a type of another class. For instance, if there is a Rectangle class and a Square class to represent rectangles and squares, since a square is a rectangle, it would make sense for the Square class to inherit the Rectangle class since they share some properties!\n\nInheritance is also used if there is a base class with methods and variables that are used by many classes but then the derived classes have some specific methods and variables unique to them. This saves code writing time since you only need to write common methods and variables once in the base class!\n\nTo inherit from a class, use the : symbol. For example, if I have a class Vehicle and I want the class Car to inherit from the class vehicle, I would define the classes as follows:\n\nclass Vehicle { \u2026 }\n\nclass Car : public Vehicle { \u2026 }\n\nThere are many useful applications of inheritance, and inheritance is one of the key elements of object oriented programming! \n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Every computer has an internal hard drive, but you can also get external hard drives that can be used to expand the storage of a computer. \n\nSSDs (solid state drives) are the newer of the type of hard drive. They have become the preferred format for high-end laptops\u2019 internal hard drives, and all smartphones and tablets also use a form of SSD.\n\nSolid-state drives use flash memory, which is also what\u2019s used in USB flash drives and memory cards for digital cameras. There are no magnets involved here, SSDs use semiconductors that store data by altering the electrical state of the trillions of circuits contained within the SSD. Because they have no moving parts, not only do they work faster (as you don\u2019t need to wait for disks to spin and heads to gather information), they also tend to last longer than HDDs.\n\nSDDs are a lot more expensive to manufacture, so while they\u2019re increasingly prevalent as the primary disk drive for high-end laptops and PCs, hard disk drives are still preferred by many as a cheaper external option.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

You must resolve this merge conflict with a new commit before you can merge these branches.\n\n1. Open Terminal.\n\n2. Navigate into the local Git repository that has the merge conflict.\n\n3. Generate a list of the files affected by the merge conflict using the command git status\n\n4. Open your favorite text editor, such as Visual Studio Code, and navigate to the file that has merge conflicts.\n\n5. To see the beginning of the merge conflict in your file, search the file for the conflict marker <<<<<<<. When you open the file in your text editor, you'll see the changes from the HEAD or base branch after the line <<<<<<< HEAD. Next, you'll see =======, which divides your changes from the changes in the other branch, followed by >>>>>>> BRANCH-NAME. In this example, one person wrote \"open an issue\" in the base or HEAD branch and another person wrote \"ask your question in IRC\" in the compare branch or branch-a.\n\nIf you have questions, please\n<<<<<<< HEAD\nopen an issue\n=======\nask your question in IRC.\n>>>>>>> branch-a\n\n6. Decide if you want to keep only your branch's changes, keep only the other branch's changes, or make a brand new change, which may incorporate changes from both branches. Delete the conflict markers <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>> and make the changes you want in the final merge. In this example, both changes are incorporated into the final merge:\n\n7. Add and commit your new file!\n\n\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

It was conceived by Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956.\n\nThe algorithm maintains a set of visited vertices and a set of unvisited vertices. It starts at the source vertex and iteratively selects the unvisited vertex with the smallest tentative distance from the source. It then visits the neighbors of this vertex and updates their tentative distances if a shorter path is found. This process continues until the destination vertex is reached, or all reachable vertices have been visited.\n\nThe need for Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm arises in many applications where finding the shortest path between two points is crucial.\n\nFor example, It can be used in the routing protocols for computer networks and also used by map systems to find the shortest path between starting point and the Destination (as explained in How does Google Maps work?).\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

We group the \"inheritance concept\" into two categories:\n\nderived class (child) - the class that inherits from another class\nbase class (parent) - the class being inherited from\n\nUsually inheritance is used if one class is a type of another class. For instance, if there is a Rectangle class and a Square class to represent rectangles and squares, since a square is a rectangle, it would make sense for the Square class to inherit the Rectangle class since they share some properties!\n\nInheritance is also used if there is a base class with methods and variables that are used by many classes but then the derived classes have some specific methods and variables unique to them. This saves code writing time since you only need to write common methods and variables once in the base class!\n\nTo inherit from a class, use the : symbol. For example, if I have a class Vehicle and I want the class Car to inherit from the class vehicle, I would define the classes as follows:\n\nclass Vehicle { \u2026 }\n\nclass Car : public Vehicle { \u2026 }\n\nThere are many useful applications of inheritance, and inheritance is one of the key elements of object oriented programming! \n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

It is used to access the public members of a class, structure, or members of a union with the help of a pointer variable.\n\nThere is a .(dot) operator in C++ that is also used to access the members of a class. But .(dot operator) accesses the member or variable directly without using the pointers whereas instead of accessing members directly the arrow operator(->) in C++ uses a pointer to access them. So the advantage of the -> operator is that it can deal with both pointer and non-pointer access but the dot(.) operator can only be used to access the members of a class.\n\nArrow (->) operator in C++ represents the same meaning which is done by the (*) asterisk operator and dot(.) operator. Arrow operator can be written in a different way which is using the combination of two operators *.. For example, (*s).element is the same as s->element. The brackets (parenthesis) used while using the combination of (*.) operators show that the precedence of the dot(.) operator is more than *.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Every computer has an internal hard drive, but you can also get external hard drives that can be used to expand the storage of a computer. \n\nSSDs (solid state drives) are the newer of the type of hard drive. They have become the preferred format for high-end laptops\u2019 internal hard drives, and all smartphones and tablets also use a form of SSD.\n\nSolid-state drives use flash memory, which is also what\u2019s used in USB flash drives and memory cards for digital cameras. There are no magnets involved here, SSDs use semiconductors that store data by altering the electrical state of the trillions of circuits contained within the SSD. Because they have no moving parts, not only do they work faster (as you don\u2019t need to wait for disks to spin and heads to gather information), they also tend to last longer than HDDs.\n\nSDDs are a lot more expensive to manufacture, so while they\u2019re increasingly prevalent as the primary disk drive for high-end laptops and PCs, hard disk drives are still preferred by many as a cheaper external option.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Whenever you get a segfault you know you are doing something wrong with memory \u2013 accessing a variable that has already been freed, writing to a read-only portion of the memory, etc.\n\nA few common ways to get a segmentation fault is to dereference a null pointer, try to write to a portion of the memory marked as read-only (i.e. using char or const in the pointer declaration), use dangling pointers, meaning a pointer points to something that no longer exists (this usually happens when pointers are declared and used in different scopes), or improperly allocate and free dynamic memory.\n\nHere is a list of steps to take to try and resolve a segmentation fault:\n\n1. Check that you are not trying to modify a string literal. This means you are trying to modify a string that was declared using char, making it read only. If this is the case, either remove char from the declaration or do not attempt to modify the string.\n\n2. Check if you are trying to access an address that has been freed. For instance, if you have allocated something in dynamic memory and then deleted it, you cannot try to access it again. Similarly, if you are using dynamic memory and have forgotten to call delete once you are done with it, this can also cause a segmentation fault.\n\n3. Are you accessing an out-of-bounds array index? In C and C++, there is no array bounds checking, so if you have an array of four items and try to access an element at position 6, a segmentation fault can occur. Many times a program tries to access an element in an array that is just beyond the bounds of an array, usually due to an error in a loop declaration.\n\n4. It may be due to stack overflow. While this is not a common problem, this can occur if you run out of memory in your stack. It is also a type of memory corruption that may happen due to large array size, a large number of recursive calls, lots of local variables, etc. This segmentation fault may be raised even if you don\u2019t have any pointers in your code.\n\n5. You may also receive a segmentation fault due to buffer overflows. If the data being stored in the buffer is larger than the allocated size of the buffer, a buffer overflow occurs which leads to the segmentation fault. Most of the methods in the C language do not perform bound checking, so buffer overflow happens frequently when we forget to allot the required size to the buffer.\n\n6. If you try to dereference a null or uninitialized pointer you will also get a segmentation fault.\n\n7. If using dynamic memory, remember that for every new call there should be a corresponding delete call!<end_of_turn><eos>"}

To check this, use the command \n\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n\nIf there is an error, it means you do not have a SSH key and should run ssh-keygen. If it prints an SSH key, you can proceed to the next step.\n\nIdentify the remote machine you want to set up passwordless SSH with. This will most likely be a link machine. Then, run the following command on the computer you connect with (i.e. your personal laptop or desktop):\n\nssh-copy-id username@remote_machine\n\nSo, to set up passwordless SSH with RNS202-1, use the following command:\n\nssh-copy-id username@rns202-1.cs.stolaf.edu\n\nNow every time you connect with SSH you will no longer have to enter your password.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Check if your machine\u2019s SSH service is down. You can do that by entering the following\n\nsudo service status ssh\n\nIf the command line returns that the ssh service is down, that is most likely your error. To solve it, research how to enable SSH on Mac/Windows/Linux depending on the operating system your personal computer is running.\n\n2. You may be using the wrong credentials. Double check that the hostname, your username and your password are all typed correctly. For connecting to link machines, the hostname should follow the form: rns20[2-3]-[1-20].cs.stolaf.edu where in each set of brackets you pick a number in the range and then omit the brackets from the hostname.\n\n3. If the above steps do not work, try the following. On your personal machine, enter the following command:\n\nssh -Q mac\n\nA list will print. One potential output looks something like: hmac-sha1. Next, instead of running the standard ssh command, run this command instead, using the first entry in the list you just generated:\n\nssh -m [first entry from list] username@rns20[2-3]-[1-20].cs.stolaf.edu\n\nWhere everything in brackets is replaced and the brackets are not included in the command.

This way, if you accidentally lose your laptop, you can still access your work since they are saved on a link machine. Another reason to use a link machine is that they come preinstalled with all the correct software and compilers you would need to use for your course. For instance, not all personal computers come with the C/C++ compiler preinstalled which would make compiling Data Structures homework a lot harder. Finally, the link machines use the Linux operating system which is widely regarded as the best operating system for software engineering.<end_of_turn><eos>"}

You must resolve this merge conflict with a new commit before you can merge these branches.\n\n1. Open Terminal.\n\n2. Navigate into the local Git repository that has the merge conflict.\n\n3. Generate a list of the files affected by the merge conflict using the command git status\n\n4. Open your favorite text editor, such as Visual Studio Code, and navigate to the file that has merge conflicts.\n\n5. To see the beginning of the merge conflict in your file, search the file for the conflict marker <<<<<<<. When you open the file in your text editor, you'll see the changes from the HEAD or base branch after the line <<<<<<< HEAD. Next, you'll see =======, which divides your changes from the changes in the other branch, followed by >>>>>>> BRANCH-NAME. In this example, one person wrote \"open an issue\" in the base or HEAD branch and another person wrote \"ask your question in IRC\" in the compare branch or branch-a.\n\nIf you have questions, please\n<<<<<<< HEAD\nopen an issue\n=======\nask your question in IRC.\n>>>>>>> branch-a\n\n6. Decide if you want to keep only your branch's changes, keep only the other branch's changes, or make a brand new change, which may incorporate changes from both branches. Delete the conflict markers <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>> and make the changes you want in the final merge. In this example, both changes are incorporated into the final merge:\n\n7. Add and commit your new file!\n\n\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

The first step is to add your files to be committed. You can do this by entering the following command:\n\ngit add [filenames, separated by spaces] \n\nThen, you need to commit your files by entering the following command:\n\ngit commit -m \u201csome message\u201d\n\nMake sure to include a commit message in quotations after the -m. This message should be related to the files you are changing, such as \u201cupdated file1\u201d or \u201chw01 submission.\u201d\n\nNext, make sure the link machine/your personal computer is up to date with the repository by pulling from the repository. You can do this by running the following command:\n\ngit pull origin main\n\nIf you are working with a different git branch, you can use git pull origin [branch].\n\nIf that command is successful, then you can push to git using the following command:\n\ngit push origin main\n\nAgain, if you are using a branch, you can replace main with the branch name.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

It contains definitions of functions that you can include or import using a preprocessor directive #include. This preprocessor directive tells the compiler that the header file needs to be processed prior to the compilation. For example, the <iostream> header file in C++ contains the definition of input-output functions.\n\nHeader files are used in C++ so that you don\u2019t have to write the code for every single thing. It helps to reduce the complexity and number of lines of code. It also gives you the benefit of reusing the functions that are declared in header files to different .cpp files and including a header file is way easier than writing the implementations. By using a header file, you keep the program precise and focused, which makes it manageable.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

It is used to access the public members of a class, structure, or members of a union with the help of a pointer variable.\n\nThere is a .(dot) operator in C++ that is also used to access the members of a class. But .(dot operator) accesses the member or variable directly without using the pointers whereas instead of accessing members directly the arrow operator(->) in C++ uses a pointer to access them. So the advantage of the -> operator is that it can deal with both pointer and non-pointer access but the dot(.) operator can only be used to access the members of a class.\n\nArrow (->) operator in C++ represents the same meaning which is done by the (*) asterisk operator and dot(.) operator. Arrow operator can be written in a different way which is using the combination of two operators *.. For example, (*s).element is the same as s->element. The brackets (parenthesis) used while using the combination of (*.) operators show that the precedence of the dot(.) operator is more than *.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

If it prints an SSH key, you can proceed to the next step.\n\nIdentify the remote machine you want to set up passwordless SSH with. This will most likely be a link machine. Then, run the following command on the computer you connect with (i.e. your personal laptop or desktop):\n\nssh-copy-id username@remote_machine\n\nSo, to set up passwordless SSH with RNS202-1, use the following command:\n\nssh-copy-id username@rns202-1.cs.stolaf.edu\n\nNow every time you connect with SSH you will no longer have to enter your password.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

This is useful when the size of an array is not known before the execution of a program. \n\nThe new operator is a unary operator used to dynamically allocate a block of memory and keep its address in a pointer variable at some point during the execution of a program. In other words, this operator is like a request for memory allocation on the heap memory (or the free store). And if sufficient memory is available, the dynamic space is initialized to the newly created variable or pointer.\n\nWhat happens once we do not need the variable that we've got declared dynamically? Well, we must deallocate the space in memory occupied by means of the variable.\nFor this, we use the delete operator and deallocate the block of memory that was dynamically allotted with the use of the new operator. In view of that, a programmer must de-allocate a block of memory, as soon as it is not required within the program or code or it will lead to memory leaks/segmentation faults. So, we require the delete operator to avoid memory leaks (i.e. segmentation faults). \n\nFor every use of the \u201cnew\u201d keyword there should be a use of the \u201cdelete\u201d keyword.\n\nThe new operator is a unary operator used to dynamically allocate a block of memory and keep its address in a pointer variable at some point during the execution of a program.

To fix an attribute error, check the spelling of methods (i.e. that reverse is called correctly) and that you can actually use that method on the object.<end_of_turn><eos>"}

The most important of them is hiding implementation details. A structure will by default not hide its implementation details from whoever uses it in code, while a class by default hides all its implementation details and will therefore by default prevent the programmer from accessing them. The other major difference between a class and a struct is what they are used for. A class is normally used for data abstraction and inheritance (classes can inherit other classes) whereas structs are mainly used for data grouping. Structs cannot inherit other structs. Classes are not possible to use in C, only in C++, but are generally preferred to structs since they are the key of object oriented programming.<end_of_turn><eos>"}

The first reason is it saves your work on St. Olaf servers as opposed to your local device. This way, if you accidentally lose your laptop, you can still access your work since they are saved on a link machine. Another reason to use a link machine is that they come preinstalled with all the correct software and compilers you would need to use for your course. For instance, not all personal computers come with the C/C++ compiler preinstalled which would make compiling Data Structures homework a lot harder. Finally, the link machines use the Linux operating system which is widely regarded as the best operating system for software engineering.<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug\u2014no matter how big or how small\u2014you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes. This is especially useful when working on projects with multiple people because it allows you to avoid merge conflicts. If multiple people are working on main and make different changes to a file, a merge conflict arises. However, if multiple people are working on the same file but on different branches, no merge conflict arises.<end_of_turn><eos>"}

They offer convenience and improved security when properly managed.\n\nFunctionally SSH keys resemble passwords. They grant access and control who can access what. In identity and access management, they need similar policies, provisioning, and termination as user accounts and passwords. One cannot have confidentiality, integrity, or any guarantees of continued availability of systems without controlling SSH keys.\n\nTechnically the keys are cryptographic keys using a public key cryptosystem. However, functionally they are authentication credentials and need to be managed as such.<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Every computer has an internal hard drive, but you can also get external hard drives that can be used to expand the storage of a computer. \n\nSSDs (solid state drives) are the newer of the type of hard drive. They have become the preferred format for high-end laptops\u2019 internal hard drives, and all smartphones and tablets also use a form of SSD.\n\nSolid-state drives use flash memory, which is also what\u2019s used in USB flash drives and memory cards for digital cameras. There are no magnets involved here, SSDs use semiconductors that store data by altering the electrical state of the trillions of circuits contained within the SSD. Because they have no moving parts, not only do they work faster (as you don\u2019t need to wait for disks to spin and heads to gather information), they also tend to last longer than HDDs.\n\nSDDs are a lot more expensive to manufacture, so while they\u2019re increasingly prevalent as the primary disk drive for high-end laptops and PCs, hard disk drives are still preferred by many as a cheaper external option.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

It's about following specific steps or instructions. This involves using functions and structured techniques. Essentially, C revolves around functions and the order of program operations.\nC++, in contrast, expands on C. It introduces object-oriented programming. This method uses classes and objects. These elements group related functions and data. This approach simplifies complex software design, understanding, and maintenance. The main difference between C and C++ is their approach. C is driven by functions and their execution sequence. C++, however, is based on OOP. It focuses on classes, objects and their interactions. This makes it more suited for handling complex software systems.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

To see the beginning of the merge conflict in your file, search the file for the conflict marker <<<<<<<. When you open the file in your text editor, you'll see the changes from the HEAD or base branch after the line <<<<<<< HEAD. Next, you'll see =======, which divides your changes from the changes in the other branch, followed by >>>>>>> BRANCH-NAME. In this example, one person wrote \"open an issue\" in the base or HEAD branch and another person wrote \"ask your question in IRC\" in the compare branch or branch-a.\n\nIf you have questions, please\n<<<<<<< HEAD\nopen an issue\n=======\nask your question in IRC.\n>>>>>>> branch-a\n\n6. Decide if you want to keep only your branch's changes, keep only the other branch's changes, or make a brand new change, which may incorporate changes from both branches. Delete the conflict markers <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>> and make the changes you want in the final merge. In this example, both changes are incorporated into the final merge:\n\n7. Add and commit your new file!\n\n\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

NP problems are a class of computational problems that can be solved in polynomial time by a non-deterministic machine and can be verified in polynomial time by a deterministic Machine. A problem L in NP is NP-complete if all other problems in NP can be reduced to L in polynomial time. If any NP-complete problem can be solved in polynomial time, then every problem in NP can be solved in polynomial time. NP-complete problems are the hardest problems in the NP set.\nA decision problem L is NP-complete if it follow the below two properties: \n\nL is in NP (Any solution to NP-complete problems can be checked quickly, but no efficient solution is known). \n\nEvery problem in NP is reducible to L in polynomial time. \n\nA problem is NP-Hard if it obeys the second property above and need not obey the first. Therefore, a problem is NP-complete if it is both NP and NP-hard.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.\n\nOOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained. This includes programs for manufacturing and design, as well as mobile applications; for example, OOP can be used for manufacturing system simulation software.\n\nThe organization of an object-oriented program also makes the method beneficial to collaborative development, where projects are divided into groups. Additional benefits of OOP include code reusability, scalability and efficiency.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

This compiler error indicates something that must be fixed before the code can be compiled. All these errors are detected by the compiler and thus are known as compile-time errors. \nRun-time Error - Errors which occur during program execution(run-time) after successful compilation are called run-time errors. One of the most common run-time errors is division by zero also known as Division error. These types of error are hard to find as the compiler doesn\u2019t point to the line at which the error occurs. \nLinker Error - This error occurs when after compilation we link the different object files with main\u2019s object using Ctrl+F9 key(RUN). These are errors generated when the executable of the program cannot be generated. This may be due to wrong function prototyping, incorrect header files. One of the most common linker errors is writing Main() instead of main(). \nLogical Error - On compilation and execution of a program, desired output is not obtained when certain input values are given. These types of errors which provide incorrect output but appear to be error free are called logical errors. These are one of the most common errors made by beginners of programming. \nSemantic Error - This error occurs when the statements written in the program are not meaningful to the compiler.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug\u2014no matter how big or how small\u2014you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes. This is especially useful when working on projects with multiple people because it allows you to avoid merge conflicts. If multiple people are working on main and make different changes to a file, a merge conflict arises. However, if multiple people are working on the same file but on different branches, no merge conflict arises.<end_of_turn><eos>"}

The most important of them is hiding implementation details. A structure will by default not hide its implementation details from whoever uses it in code, while a class by default hides all its implementation details and will therefore by default prevent the programmer from accessing them. The other major difference between a class and a struct is what they are used for. A class is normally used for data abstraction and inheritance (classes can inherit other classes) whereas structs are mainly used for data grouping. Structs cannot inherit other structs. Classes are not possible to use in C, only in C++, but are generally preferred to structs since they are the key of object oriented programming.<end_of_turn><eos>"}

This can happen when you misspell the name of an attribute or method or when you try to access an attribute or method that is not defined for the type of object you are working with. For example, if you have a string called myString and try to call myString.reverse() in Python, you will receive an attribute error since there is not a reverse() method for strings. To fix an attribute error, check the spelling of methods (i.e. that reverse is called correctly) and that you can actually use that method on the object.<end_of_turn><eos>"}

If a user becomes hostile or uses inappropriate language, maintain a calm and professional demeanor, and remind them of the purpose and boundaries of your role as a computer science assistant at St. Olaf College.\n\n## User\nWhat is a relative path?<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\nWhen we specify a file or directory on the command line (in the terminal, that is, in the shell) we can do so in two ways.  We can give the name in a form that is always going to be the same, regardless of what we have done before, like this:\n\n   ~/sd\n\nIn this pathname, we are using the ~ to represent the (absolute) path to the home directory, and then, within that, we are referring to the sd subdirectory.  Some other examples of absolute pathnames would be:\n\n  ~/sd/hw01/daily.cpp\n  ~/cs2\n  /usr/local/cs/cs251\n\nAnything that starts with ~ or / will be an absolute pathname.\n\nOn the other hand, we can also specify relative path names, that is, names that are relative to our current location in the file system.  Say for example that, when we first logged in, we want to go to our hw01 directory, like this (using an absolute pathname):\n\n  cd ~/sd/hw01\n\nIf we wanted to go to the hw02 directory, we could do so with a relative pathname like this:\n\n  cd ../hw02\n\nThe .. means the parent directory, which, in this case, is the sd directory, and the hw02 subdirectory is assumed to be inside it.  From there, if we wanted to go to the cs2 directory, we could use another relative pathname, like this:\n\n  cd ../../cs2\n\nIn this case, the parent of the parent of the current directory is the home directory, and the cs2 directory is found within it.\n\nIf we say something like:\n\n  cd sd\n\nThen that is a relative pathname, so it will only work if we are already in a directory that has a subdirectory named sd.  So if we are in the home directory, the command \"cd sd\" will work fine, but otherwise not.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

It was conceived by Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956.\n\nThe algorithm maintains a set of visited vertices and a set of unvisited vertices. It starts at the source vertex and iteratively selects the unvisited vertex with the smallest tentative distance from the source. It then visits the neighbors of this vertex and updates their tentative distances if a shorter path is found. This process continues until the destination vertex is reached, or all reachable vertices have been visited.\n\nThe need for Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm arises in many applications where finding the shortest path between two points is crucial.\n\nFor example, It can be used in the routing protocols for computer networks and also used by map systems to find the shortest path between starting point and the Destination (as explained in How does Google Maps work?).\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

And if sufficient memory is available, the dynamic space is initialized to the newly created variable or pointer. For every use of the \u201cnew\u201d keyword there should be a use of the \u201cdelete\u201d keyword.\n\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Well, we must deallocate the space in memory occupied by means of the variable.\nFor this, we use the delete operator and deallocate the block of memory that was dynamically allotted with the use of the new operator. In view of that, a programmer must de-allocate a block of memory, as soon as it is not required within the program or code or it will lead to memory leaks/segmentation faults. So, we require the delete operator to avoid memory leaks (i.e. segmentation faults). \n\nFor every use of the \u201cnew\u201d keyword there should be a use of the \u201cdelete\u201d keyword.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

They offer convenience and improved security when properly managed.\n\nFunctionally SSH keys resemble passwords. They grant access and control who can access what. In identity and access management, they need similar policies, provisioning, and termination as user accounts and passwords. One cannot have confidentiality, integrity, or any guarantees of continued availability of systems without controlling SSH keys.\n\nTechnically the keys are cryptographic keys using a public key cryptosystem. However, functionally they are authentication credentials and need to be managed as such.<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Another reason to use a link machine is that they come preinstalled with all the correct software and compilers you would need to use for your course. For instance, not all personal computers come with the C/C++ compiler preinstalled which would make compiling Data Structures homework a lot harder. Finally, the link machines use the Linux operating system which is widely regarded as the best operating system for software engineering.<end_of_turn><eos>"}

The first reason is it saves your work on St. Olaf servers as opposed to your local device. This way, if you accidentally lose your laptop, you can still access your work since they are saved on a link machine. Another reason to use a link machine is that they come preinstalled with all the correct software and compilers you would need to use for your course. For instance, not all personal computers come with the C/C++ compiler preinstalled which would make compiling Data Structures homework a lot harder. Finally, the link machines use the Linux operating system which is widely regarded as the best operating system for software engineering.<end_of_turn><eos>"}

They offer convenience and improved security when properly managed.\n\nFunctionally SSH keys resemble passwords. They grant access and control who can access what. In identity and access management, they need similar policies, provisioning, and termination as user accounts and passwords. One cannot have confidentiality, integrity, or any guarantees of continued availability of systems without controlling SSH keys.\n\nTechnically the keys are cryptographic keys using a public key cryptosystem. However, functionally they are authentication credentials and need to be managed as such.<end_of_turn><eos>"}

To start, open VSCode, and on the left side of the window open the extensions tab (the icon with four squares at the end of the list of icons).\n\nIn the search bar that appears in the extensions tab, search for \u201cssh.\u201d Select \u201cRemote - SSH\u201d when it appears (it should be near the top and is created by Microsoft).\n\nInstall the extension, and follow any instructions during the installation process. Once it has been installed, quit and relaunch VSCode (just to make sure everything is configured correctly). You should now see a new icon above the extensions icon that has a screen with arrows in a circle. Select that icon. It will bring up the remote explorer tab (the icon looks like a computer with greater than and less than signs in the bottom right corner).\n\nIn the remote explorer tab, make sure SSH Targets is selected in the top dropdown menu and you see the SSH Targets list underneath. To add an SSH connection, hover over the SSH Targets list header, and then click the plus that appears to the right of that heading.\n\nIn the prompt that appears, type:\n\nssh username@rns20x-y.cs.stolaf.edu\n\nwhere you replace username with your St. Olaf username, x with either 2 or 3 (for RNS 202 and 203), and y with a number in the range 1-27. These correspond to each link machine in RNS 202 and 203. Then hit enter. \n\nIn the next screen that appears, just press enter again, you want to update your default SSH configuration profile.\n\nAfter you have done that, you will see the host added in the remote explorer tab under SSH Targets.\n\nNext, hover over the name of the host and you will see a little button appear to the right of the name that looks like a window with a plus. Click that button.\n\nA new window will pop up. You may receive a prompt asking you to select the platform of the remote host. If so, select Linux. Also, if this is the first time you are connecting to the host, you will receive a prompt talking about a fingerprint. Select Continue. \n\nIt will then ask you for your password (this is your St. Olaf password). \n\nOnce you have entered your password, you can tell if you are connected to the link machine by looking in the bottom left corner and verifying that the name of the link machine is listed there.\n\n\nIf at any point you get a connection refused error, try the following steps:\n\nCheck if your machine\u2019s SSH service is down. You can do that by entering the following sudo service status ssh If the command line returns that the ssh service is down, that is most likely your error. To solve it, research how to enable SSH on Mac/Windows/Linux depending on the operating system your personal computer is running. \n\nYou may be using the wrong credentials. Double check that the hostname, your username and your password are all typed correctly. For connecting to link machines, the hostname should follow the form: \n\nrns20[2-3]-[1-20].cs.stolaf.edu \n\nwhere in each set of brackets you pick a number in the range and then omit the brackets from the hostname.\n\nIf the above steps do not work, try the following. On your personal machine, enter the following command: \n\nssh -Q mac \n\nA list will print. One potential output looks something like: hmac-sha1. Next, instead of running the standard ssh command, run this command instead, using the first entry in the list you just generated: \n\nssh -m [first entry from list] username@rns20[2-3]-[1-20].cs.stolaf.edu \n\nWhere everything in brackets is replaced and the brackets are not included in the command. Repeat the above command with other entries in the list you generated until one of them works. To try with hmac-sha1 on the rns202-1 link machine, the command would be:\n\nssh -m hmac-sha1 username@rns202-1.cs.stolaf.edu\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Well, we must deallocate the space in memory occupied by means of the variable.\nFor this, we use the delete operator and deallocate the block of memory that was dynamically allotted with the use of the new operator. In view of that, a programmer must de-allocate a block of memory, as soon as it is not required within the program or code or it will lead to memory leaks/segmentation faults. So, we require the delete operator to avoid memory leaks (i.e. segmentation faults). \n\nFor every use of the \u201cnew\u201d keyword there should be a use of the \u201cdelete\u201d keyword.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Every computer has an internal hard drive, but you can also get external hard drives that can be used to expand the storage of a computer. \n\nSSDs (solid state drives) are the newer of the type of hard drive. They have become the preferred format for high-end laptops\u2019 internal hard drives, and all smartphones and tablets also use a form of SSD.\n\nSolid-state drives use flash memory, which is also what\u2019s used in USB flash drives and memory cards for digital cameras. There are no magnets involved here, SSDs use semiconductors that store data by altering the electrical state of the trillions of circuits contained within the SSD. Because they have no moving parts, not only do they work faster (as you don\u2019t need to wait for disks to spin and heads to gather information), they also tend to last longer than HDDs.\n\nSDDs are a lot more expensive to manufacture, so while they\u2019re increasingly prevalent as the primary disk drive for high-end laptops and PCs, hard disk drives are still preferred by many as a cheaper external option.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

In view of that, a programmer must de-allocate a block of memory, as soon as it is not required within the program or code or it will lead to memory leaks/segmentation faults. So, we require the delete operator to avoid memory leaks (i.e. segmentation faults). \n\nFor every use of the \u201cnew\u201d keyword there should be a use of the \u201cdelete\u201d keyword.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Every computer has an internal hard drive, but you can also get external hard drives that can be used to expand the storage of a computer. \n\nSSDs (solid state drives) are the newer of the type of hard drive. They have become the preferred format for high-end laptops\u2019 internal hard drives, and all smartphones and tablets also use a form of SSD.\n\nSolid-state drives use flash memory, which is also what\u2019s used in USB flash drives and memory cards for digital cameras. There are no magnets involved here, SSDs use semiconductors that store data by altering the electrical state of the trillions of circuits contained within the SSD. Because they have no moving parts, not only do they work faster (as you don\u2019t need to wait for disks to spin and heads to gather information), they also tend to last longer than HDDs.\n\nSDDs are a lot more expensive to manufacture, so while they\u2019re increasingly prevalent as the primary disk drive for high-end laptops and PCs, hard disk drives are still preferred by many as a cheaper external option.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.\n\nOOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained. This includes programs for manufacturing and design, as well as mobile applications; for example, OOP can be used for manufacturing system simulation software.\n\nThe organization of an object-oriented program also makes the method beneficial to collaborative development, where projects are divided into groups. Additional benefits of OOP include code reusability, scalability and efficiency.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

To start, open VSCode, and on the left side of the window open the extensions tab (the icon with four squares at the end of the list of icons).\n\nIn the search bar that appears in the extensions tab, search for \u201cssh.\u201d Select \u201cRemote - SSH\u201d when it appears (it should be near the top and is created by Microsoft).\n\nInstall the extension, and follow any instructions during the installation process. Once it has been installed, quit and relaunch VSCode (just to make sure everything is configured correctly). You should now see a new icon above the extensions icon that has a screen with arrows in a circle. Select that icon. It will bring up the remote explorer tab (the icon looks like a computer with greater than and less than signs in the bottom right corner).\n\nIn the remote explorer tab, make sure SSH Targets is selected in the top dropdown menu and you see the SSH Targets list underneath. To add an SSH connection, hover over the SSH Targets list header, and then click the plus that appears to the right of that heading.\n\nIn the prompt that appears, type:\n\nssh username@rns20x-y.cs.stolaf.edu\n\nwhere you replace username with your St. Olaf username, x with either 2 or 3 (for RNS 202 and 203), and y with a number in the range 1-27. These correspond to each link machine in RNS 202 and 203. Then hit enter. \n\nIn the next screen that appears, just press enter again, you want to update your default SSH configuration profile.\n\nAfter you have done that, you will see the host added in the remote explorer tab under SSH Targets.\n\nNext, hover over the name of the host and you will see a little button appear to the right of the name that looks like a window with a plus. Click that button.\n\nA new window will pop up. You may receive a prompt asking you to select the platform of the remote host. If so, select Linux. Also, if this is the first time you are connecting to the host, you will receive a prompt talking about a fingerprint. Select Continue. \n\nIt will then ask you for your password (this is your St. Olaf password). \n\nOnce you have entered your password, you can tell if you are connected to the link machine by looking in the bottom left corner and verifying that the name of the link machine is listed there.\n\n\nIf at any point you get a connection refused error, try the following steps:\n\nCheck if your machine\u2019s SSH service is down. You can do that by entering the following sudo service status ssh If the command line returns that the ssh service is down, that is most likely your error. To solve it, research how to enable SSH on Mac/Windows/Linux depending on the operating system your personal computer is running. \n\nYou may be using the wrong credentials. Double check that the hostname, your username and your password are all typed correctly. For connecting to link machines, the hostname should follow the form: \n\nrns20[2-3]-[1-20].cs.stolaf.edu \n\nwhere in each set of brackets you pick a number in the range and then omit the brackets from the hostname.\n\nIf the above steps do not work, try the following. On your personal machine, enter the following command: \n\nssh -Q mac \n\nA list will print. One potential output looks something like: hmac-sha1. Next, instead of running the standard ssh command, run this command instead, using the first entry in the list you just generated: \n\nssh -m [first entry from list] username@rns20[2-3]-[1-20].cs.stolaf.edu \n\nWhere everything in brackets is replaced and the brackets are not included in the command. Repeat the above command with other entries in the list you generated until one of them works. To try with hmac-sha1 on the rns202-1 link machine, the command would be:\n\nssh -m hmac-sha1 username@rns202-1.cs.stolaf.edu\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

It's about following specific steps or instructions. This involves using functions and structured techniques. Essentially, C revolves around functions and the order of program operations.\nC++, in contrast, expands on C. It introduces object-oriented programming. This method uses classes and objects. These elements group related functions and data. This approach simplifies complex software design, understanding, and maintenance. The main difference between C and C++ is their approach. C is driven by functions and their execution sequence. C++, however, is based on OOP. It focuses on classes, objects and their interactions. This makes it more suited for handling complex software systems.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

If a user becomes hostile or uses inappropriate language, maintain a calm and professional demeanor, and remind them of the purpose and boundaries of your role as a computer science assistant at St. Olaf College.\n\n## User\nCould you shed light on the term \"segmentation fault\"?<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\nA Segmentation fault is a specific kind of error caused by accessing memory that \u201cdoes not belong to you.\u201d It\u2019s a helper mechanism that keeps you from corrupting the memory and introducing hard-to-debug memory bugs. Whenever you get a segfault you know you are doing something wrong with memory \u2013 accessing a variable that has already been freed, writing to a read-only portion of the memory, etc.\n\nA few common ways to get a segmentation fault is to dereference a null pointer, try to write to a portion of the memory marked as read-only (i.e. using char or const in the pointer declaration), use dangling pointers, meaning a pointer points to something that no longer exists (this usually happens when pointers are declared and used in different scopes), or improperly allocate and free dynamic memory.\n\nHere is a list of steps to take to try and resolve a segmentation fault:\n\n1. Check that you are not trying to modify a string literal. This means you are trying to modify a string that was declared using char, making it read only. If this is the case, either remove char from the declaration or do not attempt to modify the string.\n\n2. Check if you are trying to access an address that has been freed. For instance, if you have allocated something in dynamic memory and then deleted it, you cannot try to access it again. Similarly, if you are using dynamic memory and have forgotten to call delete once you are done with it, this can also cause a segmentation fault.\n\n3. Are you accessing an out-of-bounds array index? In C and C++, there is no array bounds checking, so if you have an array of four items and try to access an element at position 6, a segmentation fault can occur. Many times a program tries to access an element in an array that is just beyond the bounds of an array, usually due to an error in a loop declaration.\n\n4. It may be due to stack overflow. While this is not a common problem, this can occur if you run out of memory in your stack. It is also a type of memory corruption that may happen due to large array size, a large number of recursive calls, lots of local variables, etc. This segmentation fault may be raised even if you don\u2019t have any pointers in your code.\n\n5. You may also receive a segmentation fault due to buffer overflows. If the data being stored in the buffer is larger than the allocated size of the buffer, a buffer overflow occurs which leads to the segmentation fault. Most of the methods in the C language do not perform bound checking, so buffer overflow happens frequently when we forget to allot the required size to the buffer.\n\n6. If you try to dereference a null or uninitialized pointer you will also get a segmentation fault.\n\n7. If using dynamic memory, remember that for every new call there should be a corresponding delete call!<end_of_turn><eos>"}

In other words, building programs by applying and composing functions. \nFunctional programming harnesses language support by using functions as variables, arguments, and return values\u2014creating elegant and clean code in the process. FP also uses immutable data and avoids concepts like shared states. This is in contrast to object-oriented programming (OOP), which uses mutable data and shared states.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.\n\nOOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained. This includes programs for manufacturing and design, as well as mobile applications; for example, OOP can be used for manufacturing system simulation software.\n\nThe organization of an object-oriented program also makes the method beneficial to collaborative development, where projects are divided into groups. Additional benefits of OOP include code reusability, scalability and efficiency.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

For basic linking, you can just include multiple files in the g++ compile command like this:\n\ng++ foo1.cpp foo2.cpp\n\nThis produces an executable file a.out where you can use ./a.out to run it. However, we generally use the following method for linking more files as it means a change in one file does not mean every file needs to be recompiled. To do this, you create .o files for each cpp/header file and then link them together. An example is shown here: \n\ng++ -c foo1.cpp\ng++ -c foo2.cpp\ng++ -o foo foo1.o foo2.o\n\nThis produces an executable file foo where you use ./foo to run it. If you made a change to foo2.cpp, you would only need to rerun:\n\ng++ -c foo2.cpp\ng++ -o foo foo1.o foo2.o\n\nsince no changes were made to foo1.cpp so foo1.o remains the same.\n\ng++ foo1.cpp foo2.cpp\n\nThis produces an executable file a.out where you can use ./a.out to run it. For more advanced linking, i.e. to create .o files for each cpp/header file and then link them together, you can use the following command:\n\ng++ -c foo1.cpp\ng++ -c foo2.cpp\ng++ -o foo foo1.o foo2.o\n\nThis produces an executable file foo where you use ./foo to run it.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

The most important of them is hiding implementation details. A structure will by default not hide its implementation details from whoever uses it in code, while a class by default hides all its implementation details and will therefore by default prevent the programmer from accessing them. The other major difference between a class and a struct is what they are used for. A class is normally used for data abstraction and inheritance (classes can inherit other classes) whereas structs are mainly used for data grouping. Structs cannot inherit other structs. Classes are not possible to use in C, only in C++, but are generally preferred to structs since they are the key of object oriented programming.<end_of_turn><eos>"}

This is useful when the size of an array is not known before the execution of a program. \n\nThe new operator is a unary operator used to dynamically allocate a block of memory and keep its address in a pointer variable at some point during the execution of a program. In other words, this operator is like a request for memory allocation on the heap memory (or the free store). And if sufficient memory is available, the dynamic space is initialized to the newly created variable or pointer.\n\nWhat happens once we do not need the variable that we've got declared dynamically? Well, we must deallocate the space in memory occupied by means of the variable.\nFor this, we use the delete operator and deallocate the block of memory that was dynamically allotted with the use of the new operator. In view of that, a programmer must de-allocate a block of memory, as soon as it is not required within the program or code or it will lead to memory leaks/segmentation faults. So, we require the delete operator to avoid memory leaks (i.e. segmentation faults). \n\nFor every use of the \u201cnew\u201d keyword there should be a use of the \u201cdelete\u201d keyword.\n\nThe new operator is a unary operator used to dynamically allocate a block of memory and keep its address in a pointer variable at some point during the execution of a program.

Whenever you get a segfault you know you are doing something wrong with memory \u2013 accessing a variable that has already been freed, writing to a read-only portion of the memory, etc.\n\nA few common ways to get a segmentation fault is to dereference a null pointer, try to write to a portion of the memory marked as read-only (i.e. using char or const in the pointer declaration), use dangling pointers, meaning a pointer points to something that no longer exists (this usually happens when pointers are declared and used in different scopes), or improperly allocate and free dynamic memory.\n\nHere is a list of steps to take to try and resolve a segmentation fault:\n\n1. Check that you are not trying to modify a string literal. This means you are trying to modify a string that was declared using char, making it read only. If this is the case, either remove char from the declaration or do not attempt to modify the string.\n\n2. Check if you are trying to access an address that has been freed. For instance, if you have allocated something in dynamic memory and then deleted it, you cannot try to access it again. Similarly, if you are using dynamic memory and have forgotten to call delete once you are done with it, this can also cause a segmentation fault.\n\n3. Are you accessing an out-of-bounds array index? In C and C++, there is no array bounds checking, so if you have an array of four items and try to access an element at position 6, a segmentation fault can occur. Many times a program tries to access an element in an array that is just beyond the bounds of an array, usually due to an error in a loop declaration.\n\n4. It may be due to stack overflow. While this is not a common problem, this can occur if you run out of memory in your stack. It is also a type of memory corruption that may happen due to large array size, a large number of recursive calls, lots of local variables, etc. This segmentation fault may be raised even if you don\u2019t have any pointers in your code.\n\n5. You may also receive a segmentation fault due to buffer overflows. If the data being stored in the buffer is larger than the allocated size of the buffer, a buffer overflow occurs which leads to the segmentation fault. Most of the methods in the C language do not perform bound checking, so buffer overflow happens frequently when we forget to allot the required size to the buffer.\n\n6. If you try to dereference a null or uninitialized pointer you will also get a segmentation fault.\n\n7. If using dynamic memory, remember that for every new call there should be a corresponding delete call!<end_of_turn><eos>"}

These elements group related functions and data. This approach simplifies complex software design, understanding, and maintenance. The main difference between C and C++ is their approach. C is driven by functions and their execution sequence. C++, however, is based on OOP. It focuses on classes, objects and their interactions. This makes it more suited for handling complex software systems.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

We can give the name in a form that is always going to be the same, regardless of what we have done before, like this:\n\n   ~/sd\n\nIn this pathname, we are using the ~ to represent the (absolute) path to the home directory, and then, within that, we are referring to the sd subdirectory.  Some other examples of absolute pathnames would be:\n\n  ~/sd/hw01/daily.cpp\n  ~/cs2\n  /usr/local/cs/cs251\n\nAnything that starts with ~ or / will be an absolute pathname.\n\nOn the other hand, we can also specify relative path names, that is, names that are relative to our current location in the file system.  Say for example that, when we first logged in, we want to go to our hw01 directory, like this (using an absolute pathname):\n\n  cd ~/sd/hw01\n\nIf we wanted to go to the hw02 directory, we could do so with a relative pathname like this:\n\n  cd ../hw02\n\nThe .. means the parent directory, which, in this case, is the sd directory, and the hw02 subdirectory is assumed to be inside it.  From there, if we wanted to go to the cs2 directory, we could use another relative pathname, like this:\n\n  cd ../../cs2\n\nIn this case, the parent of the parent of the current directory is the home directory, and the cs2 directory is found within it.\n\nIf we say something like:\n\n  cd sd\n\nThen that is a relative pathname, so it will only work if we are already in a directory that has a subdirectory named sd.  So if we are in the home directory, the command \"cd sd\" will work fine, but otherwise not.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

For basic linking, you can just include multiple files in the g++ compile command like this:\n\ng++ foo1.cpp foo2.cpp\n\nThis produces an executable file a.out where you can use ./a.out to run it. However, we generally use the following method for linking more files as it means a change in one file does not mean every file needs to be recompiled. To do this, you create .o files for each cpp/header file and then link them together. An example is shown here: \n\ng++ -c foo1.cpp\ng++ -c foo2.cpp\ng++ -o foo foo1.o foo2.o\n\nThis produces an executable file foo where you use ./foo to run it. If you made a change to foo2.cpp, you would only need to rerun:\n\ng++ -c foo2.cpp\ng++ -o foo foo1.o foo2.o\n\nsince no changes were made to foo1.cpp so foo1.o remains the same.\n\ng++ foo1.cpp foo2.cpp\n\nThis produces an executable file a.out where you can use ./a.out to run it. For more advanced linking, i.e. to create .o files for each cpp/header file and then link them together, you can use the following command:\n\ng++ -c foo1.cpp\ng++ -c foo2.cpp\ng++ -o foo foo1.o foo2.o\n\nThis produces an executable file foo where you use ./foo to run it.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

To start, open VSCode, and on the left side of the window open the extensions tab (the icon with four squares at the end of the list of icons).\n\nIn the search bar that appears in the extensions tab, search for \u201cssh.\u201d Select \u201cRemote - SSH\u201d when it appears (it should be near the top and is created by Microsoft).\n\nInstall the extension, and follow any instructions during the installation process. Once it has been installed, quit and relaunch VSCode (just to make sure everything is configured correctly). You should now see a new icon above the extensions icon that has a screen with arrows in a circle. Select that icon. It will bring up the remote explorer tab (the icon looks like a computer with greater than and less than signs in the bottom right corner).\n\nIn the remote explorer tab, make sure SSH Targets is selected in the top dropdown menu and you see the SSH Targets list underneath. To add an SSH connection, hover over the SSH Targets list header, and then click the plus that appears to the right of that heading.\n\nIn the prompt that appears, type:\n\nssh username@rns20x-y.cs.stolaf.edu\n\nwhere you replace username with your St. Olaf username, x with either 2 or 3 (for RNS 202 and 203), and y with a number in the range 1-27. These correspond to each link machine in RNS 202 and 203. Then hit enter. \n\nIn the next screen that appears, just press enter again, you want to update your default SSH configuration profile.\n\nAfter you have done that, you will see the host added in the remote explorer tab under SSH Targets.\n\nNext, hover over the name of the host and you will see a little button appear to the right of the name that looks like a window with a plus. Click that button.\n\nA new window will pop up. You may receive a prompt asking you to select the platform of the remote host. If so, select Linux. Also, if this is the first time you are connecting to the host, you will receive a prompt talking about a fingerprint. Select Continue. \n\nIt will then ask you for your password (this is your St. Olaf password). \n\nOnce you have entered your password, you can tell if you are connected to the link machine by looking in the bottom left corner and verifying that the name of the link machine is listed there.\n\n\nIf at any point you get a connection refused error, try the following steps:\n\nCheck if your machine\u2019s SSH service is down. You can do that by entering the following sudo service status ssh If the command line returns that the ssh service is down, that is most likely your error. To solve it, research how to enable SSH on Mac/Windows/Linux depending on the operating system your personal computer is running. \n\nYou may be using the wrong credentials. Double check that the hostname, your username and your password are all typed correctly. For connecting to link machines, the hostname should follow the form: \n\nrns20[2-3]-[1-20].cs.stolaf.edu \n\nwhere in each set of brackets you pick a number in the range and then omit the brackets from the hostname.\n\nIf the above steps do not work, try the following. On your personal machine, enter the following command: \n\nssh -Q mac \n\nA list will print. One potential output looks something like: hmac-sha1. Next, instead of running the standard ssh command, run this command instead, using the first entry in the list you just generated: \n\nssh -m [first entry from list] username@rns20[2-3]-[1-20].cs.stolaf.edu \n\nWhere everything in brackets is replaced and the brackets are not included in the command. Repeat the above command with other entries in the list you generated until one of them works. To try with hmac-sha1 on the rns202-1 link machine, the command would be:\n\nssh -m hmac-sha1 username@rns202-1.cs.stolaf.edu\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

The first reason is it saves your work on St. Olaf servers as opposed to your local device. This way, if you accidentally lose your laptop, you can still access your work since they are saved on a link machine. Another reason to use a link machine is that they come preinstalled with all the correct software and compilers you would need to use for your course. For instance, not all personal computers come with the C/C++ compiler preinstalled which would make compiling Data Structures homework a lot harder. Finally, the link machines use the Linux operating system which is widely regarded as the best operating system for software engineering.<end_of_turn><eos>"}

This compiler error indicates something that must be fixed before the code can be compiled. All these errors are detected by the compiler and thus are known as compile-time errors. \nRun-time Error - Errors which occur during program execution(run-time) after successful compilation are called run-time errors. One of the most common run-time errors is division by zero also known as Division error. These types of error are hard to find as the compiler doesn\u2019t point to the line at which the error occurs. \nLinker Error - This error occurs when after compilation we link the different object files with main\u2019s object using Ctrl+F9 key(RUN). These are errors generated when the executable of the program cannot be generated. This may be due to wrong function prototyping, incorrect header files. One of the most common linker errors is writing Main() instead of main(). \nLogical Error - On compilation and execution of a program, desired output is not obtained when certain input values are given. These types of errors which provide incorrect output but appear to be error free are called logical errors. These are one of the most common errors made by beginners of programming. \nSemantic Error - This error occurs when the statements written in the program are not meaningful to the compiler.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

It was conceived by Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956.\n\nThe algorithm maintains a set of visited vertices and a set of unvisited vertices. It starts at the source vertex and iteratively selects the unvisited vertex with the smallest tentative distance from the source. It then visits the neighbors of this vertex and updates their tentative distances if a shorter path is found. This process continues until the destination vertex is reached, or all reachable vertices have been visited.\n\nThe need for Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm arises in many applications where finding the shortest path between two points is crucial.\n\nFor example, It can be used in the routing protocols for computer networks and also used by map systems to find the shortest path between starting point and the Destination (as explained in How does Google Maps work?).\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

In other words, building programs by applying and composing functions. \nFunctional programming harnesses language support by using functions as variables, arguments, and return values\u2014creating elegant and clean code in the process. FP also uses immutable data and avoids concepts like shared states. This is in contrast to object-oriented programming (OOP), which uses mutable data and shared states.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

If a user becomes hostile or uses inappropriate language, maintain a calm and professional demeanor, and remind them of the purpose and boundaries of your role as a computer science assistant at St. Olaf College.\n\n## User\nHow is class inheritance used in object-oriented programming?<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\nIn C++, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the \"inheritance concept\" into two categories:\n\nderived class (child) - the class that inherits from another class\nbase class (parent) - the class being inherited from\n\nUsually inheritance is used if one class is a type of another class. For instance, if there is a Rectangle class and a Square class to represent rectangles and squares, since a square is a rectangle, it would make sense for the Square class to inherit the Rectangle class since they share some properties!\n\nInheritance is also used if there is a base class with methods and variables that are used by many classes but then the derived classes have some specific methods and variables unique to them. This saves code writing time since you only need to write common methods and variables once in the base class!\n\nTo inherit from a class, use the : symbol. For example, if I have a class Vehicle and I want the class Car to inherit from the class vehicle, I would define the classes as follows:\n\nclass Vehicle { \u2026 }\n\nclass Car : public Vehicle { \u2026 }\n\nThere are many useful applications of inheritance, and inheritance is one of the key elements of object oriented programming! \n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

In other words, this operator is like a request for memory allocation on the heap memory (or the free store). And if sufficient memory is available, the dynamic space is initialized to the newly created variable or pointer. For every use of the \u201cnew\u201d keyword there should be a use of the \u201cdelete\u201d keyword.\n\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

A problem L in NP is NP-complete if all other problems in NP can be reduced to L in polynomial time. If any NP-complete problem can be solved in polynomial time, then every problem in NP can be solved in polynomial time. NP-complete problems are the hardest problems in the NP set.\nA decision problem L is NP-complete if it follow the below two properties: \n\nL is in NP (Any solution to NP-complete problems can be checked quickly, but no efficient solution is known). \n\nEvery problem in NP is reducible to L in polynomial time. \n\nA problem is NP-Hard if it obeys the second property above and need not obey the first. Therefore, a problem is NP-complete if it is both NP and NP-hard.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Whenever you get a segfault you know you are doing something wrong with memory \u2013 accessing a variable that has already been freed, writing to a read-only portion of the memory, etc.\n\nA few common ways to get a segmentation fault is to dereference a null pointer, try to write to a portion of the memory marked as read-only (i.e. using char or const in the pointer declaration), use dangling pointers, meaning a pointer points to something that no longer exists (this usually happens when pointers are declared and used in different scopes), or improperly allocate and free dynamic memory.\n\nHere is a list of steps to take to try and resolve a segmentation fault:\n\n1. Check that you are not trying to modify a string literal. This means you are trying to modify a string that was declared using char, making it read only. If this is the case, either remove char from the declaration or do not attempt to modify the string.\n\n2. Check if you are trying to access an address that has been freed. For instance, if you have allocated something in dynamic memory and then deleted it, you cannot try to access it again. Similarly, if you are using dynamic memory and have forgotten to call delete once you are done with it, this can also cause a segmentation fault.\n\n3. Are you accessing an out-of-bounds array index? In C and C++, there is no array bounds checking, so if you have an array of four items and try to access an element at position 6, a segmentation fault can occur. Many times a program tries to access an element in an array that is just beyond the bounds of an array, usually due to an error in a loop declaration.\n\n4. It may be due to stack overflow. While this is not a common problem, this can occur if you run out of memory in your stack. It is also a type of memory corruption that may happen due to large array size, a large number of recursive calls, lots of local variables, etc. This segmentation fault may be raised even if you don\u2019t have any pointers in your code.\n\n5. You may also receive a segmentation fault due to buffer overflows. If the data being stored in the buffer is larger than the allocated size of the buffer, a buffer overflow occurs which leads to the segmentation fault. Most of the methods in the C language do not perform bound checking, so buffer overflow happens frequently when we forget to allot the required size to the buffer.\n\n6. If you try to dereference a null or uninitialized pointer you will also get a segmentation fault.\n\n7. If using dynamic memory, remember that for every new call there should be a corresponding delete call!<end_of_turn><eos>"}

For loops in different languages differ mainly by syntax and how the statements work as well as the level of expressiveness supported.\n\nFor example, in Python, you could write a for loop like this:\n\nfruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\nfor x in fruits:\n  print(x)\n\nAnd this prints \u201capple,\u201d \u201cbanana,\u201d and \u201ccherry.\u201d<end_of_turn><eos>"}

The first reason is it saves your work on St. Olaf servers as opposed to your local device. This way, if you accidentally lose your laptop, you can still access your work since they are saved on a link machine. Another reason to use a link machine is that they come preinstalled with all the correct software and compilers you would need to use for your course. For instance, not all personal computers come with the C/C++ compiler preinstalled which would make compiling Data Structures homework a lot harder. Finally, the link machines use the Linux operating system which is widely regarded as the best operating system for software engineering.<end_of_turn><eos>"}

For example, the <iostream> header file in C++ contains the definition of input-output functions.\n\nHeader files are used in C++ so that you don\u2019t have to write the code for every single thing. It helps to reduce the complexity and number of lines of code. It also gives you the benefit of reusing the functions that are declared in header files to different .cpp files and including a header file is way easier than writing the implementations. By using a header file, you keep the program precise and focused, which makes it manageable.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

The most important of them is hiding implementation details. A structure will by default not hide its implementation details from whoever uses it in code, while a class by default hides all its implementation details and will therefore by default prevent the programmer from accessing them. The other major difference between a class and a struct is what they are used for. A class is normally used for data abstraction and inheritance (classes can inherit other classes) whereas structs are mainly used for data grouping. Structs cannot inherit other structs. Classes are not possible to use in C, only in C++, but are generally preferred to structs since they are the key of object oriented programming.<end_of_turn><eos>"}

They have become the preferred format for high-end laptops\u2019 internal hard drives, and all smartphones and tablets also use a form of SSD.\n\nSolid-state drives use flash memory, which is also what\u2019s used in USB flash drives and memory cards for digital cameras. There are no magnets involved here, SSDs use semiconductors that store data by altering the electrical state of the trillions of circuits contained within the SSD. Because they have no moving parts, not only do they work faster (as you don\u2019t need to wait for disks to spin and heads to gather information), they also tend to last longer than HDDs.\n\nSDDs are a lot more expensive to manufacture, so while they\u2019re increasingly prevalent as the primary disk drive for high-end laptops and PCs, hard disk drives are still preferred by many as a cheaper external option.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained. This includes programs for manufacturing and design, as well as mobile applications; for example, OOP can be used for manufacturing system simulation software.\n\nThe organization of an object-oriented program also makes the method beneficial to collaborative development, where projects are divided into groups. Additional benefits of OOP include code reusability, scalability and efficiency.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

For basic linking, you can just include multiple files in the g++ compile command like this:\n\ng++ foo1.cpp foo2.cpp\n\nThis produces an executable file a.out where you can use ./a.out to run it. However, we generally use the following method for linking more files as it means a change in one file does not mean every file needs to be recompiled. To do this, you create .o files for each cpp/header file and then link them together. An example is shown here: \n\ng++ -c foo1.cpp\ng++ -c foo2.cpp\ng++ -o foo foo1.o foo2.o\n\nThis produces an executable file foo where you use ./foo to run it. If you made a change to foo2.cpp, you would only need to rerun:\n\ng++ -c foo2.cpp\ng++ -o foo foo1.o foo2.o\n\nsince no changes were made to foo1.cpp so foo1.o remains the same.\n\ng++ foo1.cpp foo2.cpp\n\nThis produces an executable file a.out where you can use ./a.out to run it. For more advanced linking, i.e. to create .o files for each cpp/header file and then link them together, you can use the following command:\n\ng++ -c foo1.cpp\ng++ -c foo2.cpp\ng++ -o foo foo1.o foo2.o\n\nThis produces an executable file foo where you use ./foo to run it.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

It is used to access the public members of a class, structure, or members of a union with the help of a pointer variable.\n\nThere is a .(dot) operator in C++ that is also used to access the members of a class. But .(dot operator) accesses the member or variable directly without using the pointers whereas instead of accessing members directly the arrow operator(->) in C++ uses a pointer to access them. So the advantage of the -> operator is that it can deal with both pointer and non-pointer access but the dot(.) operator can only be used to access the members of a class.\n\nArrow (->) operator in C++ represents the same meaning which is done by the (*) asterisk operator and dot(.) operator. Arrow operator can be written in a different way which is using the combination of two operators *.. For example, (*s).element is the same as s->element. The brackets (parenthesis) used while using the combination of (*.) operators show that the precedence of the dot(.) operator is more than *.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.\n\nOOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained. This includes programs for manufacturing and design, as well as mobile applications; for example, OOP can be used for manufacturing system simulation software.\n\nThe organization of an object-oriented program also makes the method beneficial to collaborative development, where projects are divided into groups. Additional benefits of OOP include code reusability, scalability and efficiency.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

We group the \"inheritance concept\" into two categories:\n\nderived class (child) - the class that inherits from another class\nbase class (parent) - the class being inherited from\n\nUsually inheritance is used if one class is a type of another class. For instance, if there is a Rectangle class and a Square class to represent rectangles and squares, since a square is a rectangle, it would make sense for the Square class to inherit the Rectangle class since they share some properties!\n\nInheritance is also used if there is a base class with methods and variables that are used by many classes but then the derived classes have some specific methods and variables unique to them. This saves code writing time since you only need to write common methods and variables once in the base class!\n\nTo inherit from a class, use the : symbol. For example, if I have a class Vehicle and I want the class Car to inherit from the class vehicle, I would define the classes as follows:\n\nclass Vehicle { \u2026 }\n\nclass Car : public Vehicle { \u2026 }\n\nThere are many useful applications of inheritance, and inheritance is one of the key elements of object oriented programming! \n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

This compiler error indicates something that must be fixed before the code can be compiled. All these errors are detected by the compiler and thus are known as compile-time errors. \nRun-time Error - Errors which occur during program execution(run-time) after successful compilation are called run-time errors. One of the most common run-time errors is division by zero also known as Division error. These types of error are hard to find as the compiler doesn\u2019t point to the line at which the error occurs. \nLinker Error - This error occurs when after compilation we link the different object files with main\u2019s object using Ctrl+F9 key(RUN). These are errors generated when the executable of the program cannot be generated. This may be due to wrong function prototyping, incorrect header files. One of the most common linker errors is writing Main() instead of main(). \nLogical Error - On compilation and execution of a program, desired output is not obtained when certain input values are given. These types of errors which provide incorrect output but appear to be error free are called logical errors. These are one of the most common errors made by beginners of programming. \nSemantic Error - This error occurs when the statements written in the program are not meaningful to the compiler.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

It was conceived by Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956.\n\nThe algorithm maintains a set of visited vertices and a set of unvisited vertices. It starts at the source vertex and iteratively selects the unvisited vertex with the smallest tentative distance from the source. It then visits the neighbors of this vertex and updates their tentative distances if a shorter path is found. This process continues until the destination vertex is reached, or all reachable vertices have been visited.\n\nThe need for Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm arises in many applications where finding the shortest path between two points is crucial.\n\nFor example, It can be used in the routing protocols for computer networks and also used by map systems to find the shortest path between starting point and the Destination (as explained in How does Google Maps work?).\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

This message should be related to the files you are changing, such as \u201cupdated file1\u201d or \u201chw01 submission.\u201d\n\nNext, make sure the link machine/your personal computer is up to date with the repository by pulling from the repository. You can do this by running the following command:\n\ngit pull origin main\n\nIf you are working with a different git branch, you can use git pull origin [branch].\n\nIf that command is successful, then you can push to git using the following command:\n\ngit push origin main\n\nAgain, if you are using a branch, you can replace main with the branch name.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

To start, open VSCode, and on the left side of the window open the extensions tab (the icon with four squares at the end of the list of icons).\n\nIn the search bar that appears in the extensions tab, search for \u201cssh.\u201d Select \u201cRemote - SSH\u201d when it appears (it should be near the top and is created by Microsoft).\n\nInstall the extension, and follow any instructions during the installation process. Once it has been installed, quit and relaunch VSCode (just to make sure everything is configured correctly). You should now see a new icon above the extensions icon that has a screen with arrows in a circle. Select that icon. It will bring up the remote explorer tab (the icon looks like a computer with greater than and less than signs in the bottom right corner).\n\nIn the remote explorer tab, make sure SSH Targets is selected in the top dropdown menu and you see the SSH Targets list underneath. To add an SSH connection, hover over the SSH Targets list header, and then click the plus that appears to the right of that heading.\n\nIn the prompt that appears, type:\n\nssh username@rns20x-y.cs.stolaf.edu\n\nwhere you replace username with your St. Olaf username, x with either 2 or 3 (for RNS 202 and 203), and y with a number in the range 1-27. These correspond to each link machine in RNS 202 and 203. Then hit enter. \n\nIn the next screen that appears, just press enter again, you want to update your default SSH configuration profile.\n\nAfter you have done that, you will see the host added in the remote explorer tab under SSH Targets.\n\nNext, hover over the name of the host and you will see a little button appear to the right of the name that looks like a window with a plus. Click that button.\n\nA new window will pop up. You may receive a prompt asking you to select the platform of the remote host. If so, select Linux. Also, if this is the first time you are connecting to the host, you will receive a prompt talking about a fingerprint. Select Continue. \n\nIt will then ask you for your password (this is your St. Olaf password). \n\nOnce you have entered your password, you can tell if you are connected to the link machine by looking in the bottom left corner and verifying that the name of the link machine is listed there.\n\n\nIf at any point you get a connection refused error, try the following steps:\n\nCheck if your machine\u2019s SSH service is down. You can do that by entering the following sudo service status ssh If the command line returns that the ssh service is down, that is most likely your error. To solve it, research how to enable SSH on Mac/Windows/Linux depending on the operating system your personal computer is running. \n\nYou may be using the wrong credentials. Double check that the hostname, your username and your password are all typed correctly. For connecting to link machines, the hostname should follow the form: \n\nrns20[2-3]-[1-20].cs.stolaf.edu \n\nwhere in each set of brackets you pick a number in the range and then omit the brackets from the hostname.\n\nIf the above steps do not work, try the following. On your personal machine, enter the following command: \n\nssh -Q mac \n\nA list will print. One potential output looks something like: hmac-sha1. Next, instead of running the standard ssh command, run this command instead, using the first entry in the list you just generated: \n\nssh -m [first entry from list] username@rns20[2-3]-[1-20].cs.stolaf.edu \n\nWhere everything in brackets is replaced and the brackets are not included in the command. Repeat the above command with other entries in the list you generated until one of them works. To try with hmac-sha1 on the rns202-1 link machine, the command would be:\n\nssh -m hmac-sha1 username@rns202-1.cs.stolaf.edu\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Well, we must deallocate the space in memory occupied by means of the variable.\nFor this, we use the delete operator and deallocate the block of memory that was dynamically allotted with the use of the new operator. In view of that, a programmer must de-allocate a block of memory, as soon as it is not required within the program or code or it will lead to memory leaks/segmentation faults. So, we require the delete operator to avoid memory leaks (i.e. segmentation faults). \n\nFor every use of the \u201cnew\u201d keyword there should be a use of the \u201cdelete\u201d keyword.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

We group the \"inheritance concept\" into two categories:\n\nderived class (child) - the class that inherits from another class\nbase class (parent) - the class being inherited from\n\nUsually inheritance is used if one class is a type of another class. For instance, if there is a Rectangle class and a Square class to represent rectangles and squares, since a square is a rectangle, it would make sense for the Square class to inherit the Rectangle class since they share some properties!\n\nInheritance is also used if there is a base class with methods and variables that are used by many classes but then the derived classes have some specific methods and variables unique to them. This saves code writing time since you only need to write common methods and variables once in the base class!\n\nTo inherit from a class, use the : symbol. For example, if I have a class Vehicle and I want the class Car to inherit from the class vehicle, I would define the classes as follows:\n\nclass Vehicle { \u2026 }\n\nclass Car : public Vehicle { \u2026 }\n\nThere are many useful applications of inheritance, and inheritance is one of the key elements of object oriented programming! \n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

We group the \"inheritance concept\" into two categories:\n\nderived class (child) - the class that inherits from another class\nbase class (parent) - the class being inherited from\n\nUsually inheritance is used if one class is a type of another class. For instance, if there is a Rectangle class and a Square class to represent rectangles and squares, since a square is a rectangle, it would make sense for the Square class to inherit the Rectangle class since they share some properties!\n\nInheritance is also used if there is a base class with methods and variables that are used by many classes but then the derived classes have some specific methods and variables unique to them. This saves code writing time since you only need to write common methods and variables once in the base class!\n\nTo inherit from a class, use the : symbol. For example, if I have a class Vehicle and I want the class Car to inherit from the class vehicle, I would define the classes as follows:\n\nclass Vehicle { \u2026 }\n\nclass Car : public Vehicle { \u2026 }\n\nThere are many useful applications of inheritance, and inheritance is one of the key elements of object oriented programming! \n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

It was conceived by Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956.\n\nThe algorithm maintains a set of visited vertices and a set of unvisited vertices. It starts at the source vertex and iteratively selects the unvisited vertex with the smallest tentative distance from the source. It then visits the neighbors of this vertex and updates their tentative distances if a shorter path is found. This process continues until the destination vertex is reached, or all reachable vertices have been visited.\n\nThe need for Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm arises in many applications where finding the shortest path between two points is crucial.\n\nFor example, It can be used in the routing protocols for computer networks and also used by map systems to find the shortest path between starting point and the Destination (as explained in How does Google Maps work?).\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

We group the \"inheritance concept\" into two categories:\n\nderived class (child) - the class that inherits from another class\nbase class (parent) - the class being inherited from\n\nUsually inheritance is used if one class is a type of another class. For instance, if there is a Rectangle class and a Square class to represent rectangles and squares, since a square is a rectangle, it would make sense for the Square class to inherit the Rectangle class since they share some properties!\n\nInheritance is also used if there is a base class with methods and variables that are used by many classes but then the derived classes have some specific methods and variables unique to them. This saves code writing time since you only need to write common methods and variables once in the base class!\n\nTo inherit from a class, use the : symbol. For example, if I have a class Vehicle and I want the class Car to inherit from the class vehicle, I would define the classes as follows:\n\nclass Vehicle { \u2026 }\n\nclass Car : public Vehicle { \u2026 }\n\nThere are many useful applications of inheritance, and inheritance is one of the key elements of object oriented programming! \n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

They have become the preferred format for high-end laptops\u2019 internal hard drives, and all smartphones and tablets also use a form of SSD.\n\nSolid-state drives use flash memory, which is also what\u2019s used in USB flash drives and memory cards for digital cameras. There are no magnets involved here, SSDs use semiconductors that store data by altering the electrical state of the trillions of circuits contained within the SSD. Because they have no moving parts, not only do they work faster (as you don\u2019t need to wait for disks to spin and heads to gather information), they also tend to last longer than HDDs.\n\nSDDs are a lot more expensive to manufacture, so while they\u2019re increasingly prevalent as the primary disk drive for high-end laptops and PCs, hard disk drives are still preferred by many as a cheaper external option.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

In identity and access management, they need similar policies, provisioning, and termination as user accounts and passwords. One cannot have confidentiality, integrity, or any guarantees of continued availability of systems without controlling SSH keys.\n\nTechnically the keys are cryptographic keys using a public key cryptosystem. However, functionally they are authentication credentials and need to be managed as such.<end_of_turn><eos>"}

We group the \"inheritance concept\" into two categories:\n\nderived class (child) - the class that inherits from another class\nbase class (parent) - the class being inherited from\n\nUsually inheritance is used if one class is a type of another class.

It helps to reduce the complexity and number of lines of code. It also gives you the benefit of reusing the functions that are declared in header files to different .cpp files and including a header file is way easier than writing the implementations. By using a header file, you keep the program precise and focused, which makes it manageable.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

They have become the preferred format for high-end laptops\u2019 internal hard drives, and all smartphones and tablets also use a form of SSD.\n\nSolid-state drives use flash memory, which is also what\u2019s used in USB flash drives and memory cards for digital cameras. There are no magnets involved here, SSDs use semiconductors that store data by altering the electrical state of the trillions of circuits contained within the SSD. Because they have no moving parts, not only do they work faster (as you don\u2019t need to wait for disks to spin and heads to gather information), they also tend to last longer than HDDs.\n\nSDDs are a lot more expensive to manufacture, so while they\u2019re increasingly prevalent as the primary disk drive for high-end laptops and PCs, hard disk drives are still preferred by many as a cheaper external option.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

For example, if you have a string called myString and try to call myString.reverse() in Python, you will receive an attribute error since there is not a reverse() method for strings. To fix an attribute error, check the spelling of methods (i.e. that reverse is called correctly) and that you can actually use that method on the object.<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Check if your machine\u2019s SSH service is down. You can do that by entering the following\n\nsudo service status ssh\n\nIf the command line returns that the ssh service is down, that is most likely your error. To solve it, research how to enable SSH on Mac/Windows/Linux depending on the operating system your personal computer is running.\n\n2. You may be using the wrong credentials. Double check that the hostname, your username and your password are all typed correctly. For connecting to link machines, the hostname should follow the form: rns20[2-3]-[1-20].cs.stolaf.edu where in each set of brackets you pick a number in the range and then omit the brackets from the hostname.\n\n3. If the above steps do not work, try the following. On your personal machine, enter the following command:\n\nssh -Q mac\n\nA list will print. One potential output looks something like: hmac-sha1. Next, instead of running the standard ssh command, run this command instead, using the first entry in the list you just generated:\n\nssh -m [first entry from list] username@rns20[2-3]-[1-20].cs.stolaf.edu\n\nWhere everything in brackets is replaced and the brackets are not included in the command. Repeat the above command with other entries in the list you generated until one of them works. \n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Well, we must deallocate the space in memory occupied by means of the variable.\nFor this, we use the delete operator and deallocate the block of memory that was dynamically allotted with the use of the new operator. In view of that, a programmer must de-allocate a block of memory, as soon as it is not required within the program or code or it will lead to memory leaks/segmentation faults. So, we require the delete operator to avoid memory leaks (i.e. segmentation faults). \n\nFor every use of the \u201cnew\u201d keyword there should be a use of the \u201cdelete\u201d keyword.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

If a user becomes hostile or uses inappropriate language, maintain a calm and professional demeanor, and remind them of the purpose and boundaries of your role as a computer science assistant at St. Olaf College.\n\n## User\nIn terminal, what are absolute and relative paths?<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\nWhen we specify a file or directory on the command line (in the terminal, that is, in the shell) we can do so in two ways.  We can give the name in a form that is always going to be the same, regardless of what we have done before, like this:\n\n   ~/sd\n\nIn this pathname, we are using the ~ to represent the (absolute) path to the home directory, and then, within that, we are referring to the sd subdirectory.  Some other examples of absolute pathnames would be:\n\n  ~/sd/hw01/daily.cpp\n  ~/cs2\n  /usr/local/cs/cs251\n\nAnything that starts with ~ or / will be an absolute pathname.\n\nOn the other hand, we can also specify relative path names, that is, names that are relative to our current location in the file system.  Say for example that, when we first logged in, we want to go to our hw01 directory, like this (using an absolute pathname):\n\n  cd ~/sd/hw01\n\nIf we wanted to go to the hw02 directory, we could do so with a relative pathname like this:\n\n  cd ../hw02\n\nThe .. means the parent directory, which, in this case, is the sd directory, and the hw02 subdirectory is assumed to be inside it.  From there, if we wanted to go to the cs2 directory, we could use another relative pathname, like this:\n\n  cd ../../cs2\n\nIn this case, the parent of the parent of the current directory is the home directory, and the cs2 directory is found within it.\n\nIf we say something like:\n\n  cd sd\n\nThen that is a relative pathname, so it will only work if we are already in a directory that has a subdirectory named sd.  So if we are in the home directory, the command \"cd sd\" will work fine, but otherwise not.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Every computer has an internal hard drive, but you can also get external hard drives that can be used to expand the storage of a computer. \n\nSSDs (solid state drives) are the newer of the type of hard drive. They have become the preferred format for high-end laptops\u2019 internal hard drives, and all smartphones and tablets also use a form of SSD.\n\nSolid-state drives use flash memory, which is also what\u2019s used in USB flash drives and memory cards for digital cameras. There are no magnets involved here, SSDs use semiconductors that store data by altering the electrical state of the trillions of circuits contained within the SSD. Because they have no moving parts, not only do they work faster (as you don\u2019t need to wait for disks to spin and heads to gather information), they also tend to last longer than HDDs.\n\nSDDs are a lot more expensive to manufacture, so while they\u2019re increasingly prevalent as the primary disk drive for high-end laptops and PCs, hard disk drives are still preferred by many as a cheaper external option.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

This means once a return statement is reached, the function does not execute any other lines of code and sends the specified value back to the caller. For instance, a sqrt(x) function would return the square root of x so you could use the following syntax:\n\ny = sqrt(x)\n\nWhere y now holds the returned value from sqrt(x).\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

We group the \"inheritance concept\" into two categories:\n\nderived class (child) - the class that inherits from another class\nbase class (parent) - the class being inherited from\n\nUsually inheritance is used if one class is a type of another class. For instance, if there is a Rectangle class and a Square class to represent rectangles and squares, since a square is a rectangle, it would make sense for the Square class to inherit the Rectangle class since they share some properties!\n\nInheritance is also used if there is a base class with methods and variables that are used by many classes but then the derived classes have some specific methods and variables unique to them. This saves code writing time since you only need to write common methods and variables once in the base class!\n\nTo inherit from a class, use the : symbol. For example, if I have a class Vehicle and I want the class Car to inherit from the class vehicle, I would define the classes as follows:\n\nclass Vehicle { \u2026 }\n\nclass Car : public Vehicle { \u2026 }\n\nThere are many useful applications of inheritance, and inheritance is one of the key elements of object oriented programming! \n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Once it has been installed, quit and relaunch VSCode (just to make sure everything is configured correctly). You should now see a new icon above the extensions icon that has a screen with arrows in a circle. Select that icon. It will bring up the remote explorer tab (the icon looks like a computer with greater than and less than signs in the bottom right corner).\n\nIn the remote explorer tab, make sure SSH Targets is selected in the top dropdown menu and you see the SSH Targets list underneath. To add an SSH connection, hover over the SSH Targets list header, and then click the plus that appears to the right of that heading.\n\nIn the prompt that appears, type:\n\nssh username@rns20x-y.cs.stolaf.edu\n\nwhere you replace username with your St. Olaf username, x with either 2 or 3 (for RNS 202 and 203), and y with a number in the range 1-27. These correspond to each link machine in RNS 202 and 203. Then hit enter. \n\nIn the next screen that appears, just press enter again, you want to update your default SSH configuration profile.\n\nAfter you have done that, you will see the host added in the remote explorer tab under SSH Targets.\n\nNext, hover over the name of the host and you will see a little button appear to the right of the name that looks like a window with a plus.

To start, open VSCode, and on the left side of the window open the extensions tab (the icon with four squares at the end of the list of icons).\n\nIn the search bar that appears in the extensions tab, search for \u201cssh.\u201d Select \u201cRemote - SSH\u201d when it appears (it should be near the top and is created by Microsoft).\n\nInstall the extension, and follow any instructions during the installation process. Once it has been installed, quit and relaunch VSCode (just to make sure everything is configured correctly). You should now see a new icon above the extensions icon that has a screen with arrows in a circle. Select that icon. It will bring up the remote explorer tab (the icon looks like a computer with greater than and less than signs in the bottom right corner).\n\nIn the remote explorer tab, make sure SSH Targets is selected in the top dropdown menu and you see the SSH Targets list underneath. To add an SSH connection, hover over the SSH Targets list header, and then click the plus that appears to the right of that heading.\n\nIn the prompt that appears, type:\n\nssh username@rns20x-y.cs.stolaf.edu\n\nwhere you replace username with your St. Olaf username, x with either 2 or 3 (for RNS 202 and 203), and y with a number in the range 1-27. These correspond to each link machine in RNS 202 and 203. Then hit enter. \n\nIn the next screen that appears, just press enter again, you want to update your default SSH configuration profile.\n\nAfter you have done that, you will see the host added in the remote explorer tab under SSH Targets.\n\nNext, hover over the name of the host and you will see a little button appear to the right of the name that looks like a window with a plus.

Every major corporation uses it, in every data center.\n\nSSH keys enable the automation that makes modern cloud services and other computer-dependent services possible and cost-effective. They offer convenience and improved security when properly managed.\n\nFunctionally SSH keys resemble passwords. They grant access and control who can access what. In identity and access management, they need similar policies, provisioning, and termination as user accounts and passwords. One cannot have confidentiality, integrity, or any guarantees of continued availability of systems without controlling SSH keys.\n\nTechnically the keys are cryptographic keys using a public key cryptosystem. However, functionally they are authentication credentials and need to be managed as such.<end_of_turn><eos>"}

This is especially useful when working on projects with multiple people because it allows you to avoid merge conflicts. If multiple people are working on main and make different changes to a file, a merge conflict arises. However, if multiple people are working on the same file but on different branches, no merge conflict arises.<end_of_turn><eos>"}

This is useful when the size of an array is not known before the execution of a program. \n\nThe new operator is a unary operator used to dynamically allocate a block of memory and keep its address in a pointer variable at some point during the execution of a program. In other words, this operator is like a request for memory allocation on the heap memory (or the free store). And if sufficient memory is available, the dynamic space is initialized to the newly created variable or pointer.\n\nWhat happens once we do not need the variable that we've got declared dynamically? Well, we must deallocate the space in memory occupied by means of the variable.\nFor this, we use the delete operator and deallocate the block of memory that was dynamically allotted with the use of the new operator. In view of that, a programmer must de-allocate a block of memory, as soon as it is not required within the program or code or it will lead to memory leaks/segmentation faults. So, we require the delete operator to avoid memory leaks (i.e. segmentation faults). \n\nFor every use of the \u201cnew\u201d keyword there should be a use of the \u201cdelete\u201d keyword.\n\nThe new operator is a unary operator used to dynamically allocate a block of memory and keep its address in a pointer variable at some point during the execution of a program.

This is useful when the size of an array is not known before the execution of a program. \n\nThe new operator is a unary operator used to dynamically allocate a block of memory and keep its address in a pointer variable at some point during the execution of a program. In other words, this operator is like a request for memory allocation on the heap memory (or the free store). And if sufficient memory is available, the dynamic space is initialized to the newly created variable or pointer.\n\nWhat happens once we do not need the variable that we've got declared dynamically? Well, we must deallocate the space in memory occupied by means of the variable.\nFor this, we use the delete operator and deallocate the block of memory that was dynamically allotted with the use of the new operator. In view of that, a programmer must de-allocate a block of memory, as soon as it is not required within the program or code or it will lead to memory leaks/segmentation faults. So, we require the delete operator to avoid memory leaks (i.e. segmentation faults). \n\nFor every use of the \u201cnew\u201d keyword there should be a use of the \u201cdelete\u201d keyword.\n\nThe new operator is a unary operator used to dynamically allocate a block of memory and keep its address in a pointer variable at some point during the execution of a program. In other words, this operator is like a request for memory allocation on the heap memory (or the free store). And if sufficient memory is available, the dynamic space is initialized to the newly created variable or pointer.\n\nWhat happens once we do not need the variable that we've got declared dynamically? Well, we must deallocate the space in memory occupied by means of the variable.\nFor this, we use the delete operator and deallocate the block of memory that was dynamically allotted with the use of the new operator. In view of that, a programmer must de-allocate a block of memory, as soon as it is not required within the program or code or it will lead to memory leaks/segmentation faults. So, we require the delete operator to avoid memory leaks (i.e. segmentation faults). \n\nFor every \u201cnew\u201d keyword there should be a \u201cdelete\u201d keyword.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

You must resolve this merge conflict with a new commit before you can merge these branches.\n\n1. Open Terminal.\n\n2. Navigate into the local Git repository that has the merge conflict.\n\n3. Generate a list of the files affected by the merge conflict using the command git status\n\n4. Open your favorite text editor, such as Visual Studio Code, and navigate to the file that has merge conflicts.\n\n5. To see the beginning of the merge conflict in your file, search the file for the conflict marker <<<<<<<. When you open the file in your text editor, you'll see the changes from the HEAD or base branch after the line <<<<<<< HEAD. Next, you'll see =======, which divides your changes from the changes in the other branch, followed by >>>>>>> BRANCH-NAME. In this example, one person wrote \"open an issue\" in the base or HEAD branch and another person wrote \"ask your question in IRC\" in the compare branch or branch-a.\n\nIf you have questions, please\n<<<<<<< HEAD\nopen an issue\n=======\nask your question in IRC.\n>>>>>>> branch-a\n\n6. Decide if you want to keep only your branch's changes, keep only the other branch's changes, or make a brand new change, which may incorporate changes from both branches. Delete the conflict markers <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>> and make the changes you want in the final merge. In this example, both changes are incorporated into the final merge:\n\n7. Add and commit your new file!\n\n\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

This can happen when we try to access an element that doesn't exist in the sequence or when we try to access an element at an index that is greater than or equal to the length of the sequence. For example, if you have an array of four elements and try to index the tenth element, which doesn\u2019t exist, you will get an index error. If you get an index error, make sure to check how big the variable you are trying to index is!<end_of_turn><eos>"}

For basic linking, you can just include multiple files in the g++ compile command like this:\n\ng++ foo1.cpp foo2.cpp\n\nThis produces an executable file a.out where you can use ./a.out to run it. However, we generally use the following method for linking more files as it means a change in one file does not mean every file needs to be recompiled. To do this, you create .o files for each cpp/header file and then link them together. An example is shown here: \n\ng++ -c foo1.cpp\ng++ -c foo2.cpp\ng++ -o foo foo1.o foo2.o\n\nThis produces an executable file foo where you use ./foo to run it. If you made a change to foo2.cpp, you would only need to rerun:\n\ng++ -c foo2.cpp\ng++ -o foo foo1.o foo2.o\n\nsince no changes were made to foo1.cpp so foo1.o remains the same.\n\ng++ foo1.cpp foo2.cpp\n\nThis produces an executable file a.out where you can use ./a.out to run it. For more advanced linking, i.e. to create .o files for each cpp/header file and then link them together, you can use the following command:\n\ng++ -c foo1.cpp\ng++ -c foo2.cpp\ng++ -o foo foo1.o foo2.o\n\nThis produces an executable file foo where you use ./foo to run it.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

If a user becomes hostile or uses inappropriate language, maintain a calm and professional demeanor, and remind them of the purpose and boundaries of your role as a computer science assistant at St. Olaf College.\n\n## User\nWhat makes absolute and relative file paths unique from each other?<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\nWhen we specify a file or directory on the command line (in the terminal, that is, in the shell) we can do so in two ways.  We can give the name in a form that is always going to be the same, regardless of what we have done before, like this:\n\n   ~/sd\n\nIn this pathname, we are using the ~ to represent the (absolute) path to the home directory, and then, within that, we are referring to the sd subdirectory.  Some other examples of absolute pathnames would be:\n\n  ~/sd/hw01/daily.cpp\n  ~/cs2\n  /usr/local/cs/cs251\n\nAnything that starts with ~ or / will be an absolute pathname.\n\nOn the other hand, we can also specify relative path names, that is, names that are relative to our current location in the file system.  Say for example that, when we first logged in, we want to go to our hw01 directory, like this (using an absolute pathname):\n\n  cd ~/sd/hw01\n\nIf we wanted to go to the hw02 directory, we could do so with a relative pathname like this:\n\n  cd ../hw02\n\nThe .. means the parent directory, which, in this case, is the sd directory, and the hw02 subdirectory is assumed to be inside it.  From there, if we wanted to go to the cs2 directory, we could use another relative pathname, like this:\n\n  cd ../../cs2\n\nIn this case, the parent of the parent of the current directory is the home directory, and the cs2 directory is found within it.\n\nIf we say something like:\n\n  cd sd\n\nThen that is a relative pathname, so it will only work if we are already in a directory that has a subdirectory named sd.  So if we are in the home directory, the command \"cd sd\" will work fine, but otherwise not.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

They have become the preferred format for high-end laptops\u2019 internal hard drives, and all smartphones and tablets also use a form of SSD.\n\nSolid-state drives use flash memory, which is also what\u2019s used in USB flash drives and memory cards for digital cameras. There are no magnets involved here, SSDs use semiconductors that store data by altering the electrical state of the trillions of circuits contained within the SSD. Because they have no moving parts, not only do they work faster (as you don\u2019t need to wait for disks to spin and heads to gather information), they also tend to last longer than HDDs.\n\nSDDs are a lot more expensive to manufacture, so while they\u2019re increasingly prevalent as the primary disk drive for high-end laptops and PCs, hard disk drives are still preferred by many as a cheaper external option.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

We group the \"inheritance concept\" into two categories:\n\nderived class (child) - the class that inherits from another class\nbase class (parent) - the class being inherited from\n\nUsually inheritance is used if one class is a type of another class. For instance, if there is a Rectangle class and a Square class to represent rectangles and squares, since a square is a rectangle, it would make sense for the Square class to inherit the Rectangle class since they share some properties!\n\nInheritance is also used if there is a base class with methods and variables that are used by many classes but then the derived classes have some specific methods and variables unique to them. This saves code writing time since you only need to write common methods and variables once in the base class!\n\nTo inherit from a class, use the : symbol. For example, if I have a class Vehicle and I want the class Car to inherit from the class vehicle, I would define the classes as follows:\n\nclass Vehicle { \u2026 }\n\nclass Car : public Vehicle { \u2026 }\n\nThere are many useful applications of inheritance, and inheritance is one of the key elements of object oriented programming! \n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

It consists of linear functions which are subjected to the constraints in the form of linear equations or in the form of inequalities. Linear programming is considered an important technique that is used to find the optimum resource utilization. The term \u201clinear programming\u201d consists of two words: linear and programming. The word \u201clinear\u201d defines the relationship between multiple variables with degree one. The word \u201cprogramming\u201d defines the process of selecting the best solution from various alternatives.<end_of_turn><eos>"}

It is used to access the public members of a class, structure, or members of a union with the help of a pointer variable.\n\nThere is a .(dot) operator in C++ that is also used to access the members of a class. But .(dot operator) accesses the member or variable directly without using the pointers whereas instead of accessing members directly the arrow operator(->) in C++ uses a pointer to access them. So the advantage of the -> operator is that it can deal with both pointer and non-pointer access but the dot(.) operator can only be used to access the members of a class.\n\nArrow (->) operator in C++ represents the same meaning which is done by the (*) asterisk operator and dot(.) operator. Arrow operator can be written in a different way which is using the combination of two operators *.. For example, (*s).element is the same as s->element. The brackets (parenthesis) used while using the combination of (*.) operators show that the precedence of the dot(.) operator is more than *.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

It is written following an if statement in Python to check an alternative condition if the first condition is false. The code block under the elif statement will be executed only if its condition is true.\n\nThe syntax for an if statement in Python is:\n\nif condition1:\n    statement to execute if condition1 is true\nelif condition2:\n    statement to execute if condition2 is true\nelse:\n    statement to execute if both conditions are false\n\nNote: in C++, instead of using elif you would use else if. Here, if condition 1 is true, the statement present inside the if block will be executed. If condition 1 is false, then the elif condition will be checked. If the elif condition is true, the statement present inside the elif block will be executed. If both conditions are false, the statement present inside the else block will be executed.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

It is written following an if statement in Python to check an alternative condition if the first condition is false. The code block under the elif statement will be executed only if its condition is true.\n\nThe syntax for an if statement in Python is:\n\nif condition1:\n    statement to execute if condition1 is true\nelif condition2:\n    statement to execute if condition2 is true\nelse:\n    statement to execute if both conditions are false\n\nNote: in C++, instead of using elif you would use else if. Here, if condition 1 is true, the statement present inside the if block will be executed. If condition 1 is false, then the elif condition will be checked. If the elif condition is true, the statement present inside the elif block will be executed. If both conditions are false, the statement present inside the else block will be executed.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Every computer has an internal hard drive, but you can also get external hard drives that can be used to expand the storage of a computer. \n\nSSDs (solid state drives) are the newer of the type of hard drive. They have become the preferred format for high-end laptops\u2019 internal hard drives, and all smartphones and tablets also use a form of SSD.\n\nSolid-state drives use flash memory, which is also what\u2019s used in USB flash drives and memory cards for digital cameras. There are no magnets involved here, SSDs use semiconductors that store data by altering the electrical state of the trillions of circuits contained within the SSD. Because they have no moving parts, not only do they work faster (as you don\u2019t need to wait for disks to spin and heads to gather information), they also tend to last longer than HDDs.\n\nSDDs are a lot more expensive to manufacture, so while they\u2019re increasingly prevalent as the primary disk drive for high-end laptops and PCs, hard disk drives are still preferred by many as a cheaper external option.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Well, we must deallocate the space in memory occupied by means of the variable.\nFor this, we use the delete operator and deallocate the block of memory that was dynamically allotted with the use of the new operator. In view of that, a programmer must de-allocate a block of memory, as soon as it is not required within the program or code or it will lead to memory leaks/segmentation faults. So, we require the delete operator to avoid memory leaks (i.e. segmentation faults). \n\nFor every use of the \u201cnew\u201d keyword there should be a use of the \u201cdelete\u201d keyword.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

These elements group related functions and data. This approach simplifies complex software design, understanding, and maintenance. The main difference between C and C++ is their approach. C is driven by functions and their execution sequence. C++, however, is based on OOP. It focuses on classes, objects and their interactions. This makes it more suited for handling complex software systems.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

This is useful when the size of an array is not known before the execution of a program. \n\nThe new operator is a unary operator used to dynamically allocate a block of memory and keep its address in a pointer variable at some point during the execution of a program. In other words, this operator is like a request for memory allocation on the heap memory (or the free store). And if sufficient memory is available, the dynamic space is initialized to the newly created variable or pointer.\n\nWhat happens once we do not need the variable that we've got declared dynamically? Well, we must deallocate the space in memory occupied by means of the variable.\nFor this, we use the delete operator and deallocate the block of memory that was dynamically allotted with the use of the new operator. In view of that, a programmer must de-allocate a block of memory, as soon as it is not required within the program or code or it will lead to memory leaks/segmentation faults. So, we require the delete operator to avoid memory leaks (i.e. segmentation faults). \n\nFor every use of the \u201cnew\u201d keyword there should be a use of the \u201cdelete\u201d keyword.\n\nThe new operator is a unary operator used to dynamically allocate a block of memory and keep its address in a pointer variable at some point during the execution of a program.

It contains definitions of functions that you can include or import using a preprocessor directive #include. This preprocessor directive tells the compiler that the header file needs to be processed prior to the compilation. For example, the <iostream> header file in C++ contains the definition of input-output functions.\n\nHeader files are used in C++ so that you don\u2019t have to write the code for every single thing. It helps to reduce the complexity and number of lines of code. It also gives you the benefit of reusing the functions that are declared in header files to different .cpp files and including a header file is way easier than writing the implementations. By using a header file, you keep the program precise and focused, which makes it manageable.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

We group the \"inheritance concept\" into two categories:\n\nderived class (child) - the class that inherits from another class\nbase class (parent) - the class being inherited from\n\nUsually inheritance is used if one class is a type of another class. For instance, if there is a Rectangle class and a Square class to represent rectangles and squares, since a square is a rectangle, it would make sense for the Square class to inherit the Rectangle class since they share some properties!\n\nInheritance is also used if there is a base class with methods and variables that are used by many classes but then the derived classes have some specific methods and variables unique to them. This saves code writing time since you only need to write common methods and variables once in the base class!\n\nTo inherit from a class, use the : symbol. For example, if I have a class Vehicle and I want the class Car to inherit from the class vehicle, I would define the classes as follows:\n\nclass Vehicle { \u2026 }\n\nclass Car : public Vehicle { \u2026 }\n\nThere are many useful applications of inheritance, and inheritance is one of the key elements of object oriented programming! \n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

They have become the preferred format for high-end laptops\u2019 internal hard drives, and all smartphones and tablets also use a form of SSD.\n\nSolid-state drives use flash memory, which is also what\u2019s used in USB flash drives and memory cards for digital cameras. There are no magnets involved here, SSDs use semiconductors that store data by altering the electrical state of the trillions of circuits contained within the SSD. Because they have no moving parts, not only do they work faster (as you don\u2019t need to wait for disks to spin and heads to gather information), they also tend to last longer than HDDs.\n\nSDDs are a lot more expensive to manufacture, so while they\u2019re increasingly prevalent as the primary disk drive for high-end laptops and PCs, hard disk drives are still preferred by many as a cheaper external option.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

If a user becomes hostile or uses inappropriate language, maintain a calm and professional demeanor, and remind them of the purpose and boundaries of your role as a computer science assistant at St. Olaf College.\n\n## User\nHow do you characterize a segmentation fault?<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\nA Segmentation fault is a specific kind of error caused by accessing memory that \u201cdoes not belong to you.\u201d It\u2019s a helper mechanism that keeps you from corrupting the memory and introducing hard-to-debug memory bugs. Whenever you get a segfault you know you are doing something wrong with memory \u2013 accessing a variable that has already been freed, writing to a read-only portion of the memory, etc.\n\nA few common ways to get a segmentation fault is to dereference a null pointer, try to write to a portion of the memory marked as read-only (i.e. using char or const in the pointer declaration), use dangling pointers, meaning a pointer points to something that no longer exists (this usually happens when pointers are declared and used in different scopes), or improperly allocate and free dynamic memory.\n\nHere is a list of steps to take to try and resolve a segmentation fault:\n\n1. Check that you are not trying to modify a string literal. This means you are trying to modify a string that was declared using char, making it read only. If this is the case, either remove char from the declaration or do not attempt to modify the string.\n\n2. Check if you are trying to access an address that has been freed. For instance, if you have allocated something in dynamic memory and then deleted it, you cannot try to access it again. Similarly, if you are using dynamic memory and have forgotten to call delete once you are done with it, this can also cause a segmentation fault.\n\n3. Are you accessing an out-of-bounds array index? In C and C++, there is no array bounds checking, so if you have an array of four items and try to access an element at position 6, a segmentation fault can occur. Many times a program tries to access an element in an array that is just beyond the bounds of an array, usually due to an error in a loop declaration.\n\n4. It may be due to stack overflow. While this is not a common problem, this can occur if you run out of memory in your stack. It is also a type of memory corruption that may happen due to large array size, a large number of recursive calls, lots of local variables, etc. This segmentation fault may be raised even if you don\u2019t have any pointers in your code.\n\n5. You may also receive a segmentation fault due to buffer overflows. If the data being stored in the buffer is larger than the allocated size of the buffer, a buffer overflow occurs which leads to the segmentation fault. Most of the methods in the C language do not perform bound checking, so buffer overflow happens frequently when we forget to allot the required size to the buffer.\n\n6. If you try to dereference a null or uninitialized pointer you will also get a segmentation fault.\n\n7. If using dynamic memory, remember that for every new call there should be a corresponding delete call!<end_of_turn><eos>"}

To solve it, research how to enable SSH on Mac/Windows/Linux depending on the operating system your personal computer is running.\n\n2. You may be using the wrong credentials. Double check that the hostname, your username and your password are all typed correctly. For connecting to link machines, the hostname should follow the form: rns20[2-3]-[1-20].cs.stolaf.edu where in each set of brackets you pick a number in the range and then omit the brackets from the hostname.\n\n3.

For basic linking, you can just include multiple files in the g++ compile command like this:\n\ng++ foo1.cpp foo2.cpp\n\nThis produces an executable file a.out where you can use ./a.out to run it. However, we generally use the following method for linking more files as it means a change in one file does not mean every file needs to be recompiled. To do this, you create .o files for each cpp/header file and then link them together. An example is shown here: \n\ng++ -c foo1.cpp\ng++ -c foo2.cpp\ng++ -o foo foo1.o foo2.o\n\nThis produces an executable file foo where you use ./foo to run it. If you made a change to foo2.cpp, you would only need to rerun:\n\ng++ -c foo2.cpp\ng++ -o foo foo1.o foo2.o\n\nsince no changes were made to foo1.cpp so foo1.o remains the same.\n\ng++ foo1.cpp foo2.cpp\n\nThis produces an executable file a.out where you can use ./a.out to run it. For more advanced linking, i.e. to create .o files for each cpp/header file and then link them together, you can use the following command:\n\ng++ -c foo1.cpp\ng++ -c foo2.cpp\ng++ -o foo foo1.o foo2.o\n\nThis produces an executable file foo where you use ./foo to run it.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

This compiler error indicates something that must be fixed before the code can be compiled. All these errors are detected by the compiler and thus are known as compile-time errors. \nRun-time Error - Errors which occur during program execution(run-time) after successful compilation are called run-time errors. One of the most common run-time errors is division by zero also known as Division error. These types of error are hard to find as the compiler doesn\u2019t point to the line at which the error occurs. \nLinker Error - This error occurs when after compilation we link the different object files with main\u2019s object using Ctrl+F9 key(RUN). These are errors generated when the executable of the program cannot be generated. This may be due to wrong function prototyping, incorrect header files. One of the most common linker errors is writing Main() instead of main(). \nLogical Error - On compilation and execution of a program, desired output is not obtained when certain input values are given. These types of errors which provide incorrect output but appear to be error free are called logical errors. These are one of the most common errors made by beginners of programming. \nSemantic Error - This error occurs when the statements written in the program are not meaningful to the compiler.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

NP problems are a class of computational problems that can be solved in polynomial time by a non-deterministic machine and can be verified in polynomial time by a deterministic Machine. A problem L in NP is NP-complete if all other problems in NP can be reduced to L in polynomial time. If any NP-complete problem can be solved in polynomial time, then every problem in NP can be solved in polynomial time. NP-complete problems are the hardest problems in the NP set.\nA decision problem L is NP-complete if it follow the below two properties: \n\nL is in NP (Any solution to NP-complete problems can be checked quickly, but no efficient solution is known). \n\nEvery problem in NP is reducible to L in polynomial time. \n\nA problem is NP-Hard if it obeys the second property above and need not obey the first. Therefore, a problem is NP-complete if it is both NP and NP-hard.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Private means members of a class cannot be accessed (or viewed) from outside the class. This is useful if there are variables or methods that are only used by the class to perform operations and are not intended to be used by other programmers. Note: By default, all members of a class are private if you don't specify an access specifier.<end_of_turn><eos>"}

This can happen when trying to perform arithmetic or logical operations on incompatible data types or when passing arguments of the wrong type to a function. For example, if you try to add a string and an integer, the compiler does not know what you are trying to do so a TypeError will be raised. To fix it, make sure the functions or operations you are using are compatible with the variables you are using them with.<end_of_turn><eos>"}

It was conceived by Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956.\n\nThe algorithm maintains a set of visited vertices and a set of unvisited vertices. It starts at the source vertex and iteratively selects the unvisited vertex with the smallest tentative distance from the source. It then visits the neighbors of this vertex and updates their tentative distances if a shorter path is found. This process continues until the destination vertex is reached, or all reachable vertices have been visited.\n\nThe need for Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm arises in many applications where finding the shortest path between two points is crucial.\n\nFor example, It can be used in the routing protocols for computer networks and also used by map systems to find the shortest path between starting point and the Destination (as explained in How does Google Maps work?).\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

It helps to reduce the complexity and number of lines of code. It also gives you the benefit of reusing the functions that are declared in header files to different .cpp files and including a header file is way easier than writing the implementations. By using a header file, you keep the program precise and focused, which makes it manageable.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

For loops in different languages differ mainly by syntax and how the statements work as well as the level of expressiveness supported.\n\nFor example, in Python, you could write a for loop like this:\n\nfruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\nfor x in fruits:\n  print(x)\n\nAnd this prints \u201capple,\u201d \u201cbanana,\u201d and \u201ccherry.\u201d<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Well, we must deallocate the space in memory occupied by means of the variable.\nFor this, we use the delete operator and deallocate the block of memory that was dynamically allotted with the use of the new operator. In view of that, a programmer must de-allocate a block of memory, as soon as it is not required within the program or code or it will lead to memory leaks/segmentation faults. So, we require the delete operator to avoid memory leaks (i.e. segmentation faults). \n\nFor every use of the \u201cnew\u201d keyword there should be a use of the \u201cdelete\u201d keyword.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

It was conceived by Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956.\n\nThe algorithm maintains a set of visited vertices and a set of unvisited vertices. It starts at the source vertex and iteratively selects the unvisited vertex with the smallest tentative distance from the source. It then visits the neighbors of this vertex and updates their tentative distances if a shorter path is found. This process continues until the destination vertex is reached, or all reachable vertices have been visited.\n\nThe need for Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm arises in many applications where finding the shortest path between two points is crucial.\n\nFor example, It can be used in the routing protocols for computer networks and also used by map systems to find the shortest path between starting point and the Destination (as explained in How does Google Maps work?).\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

We group the \"inheritance concept\" into two categories:\n\nderived class (child) - the class that inherits from another class\nbase class (parent) - the class being inherited from\n\nUsually inheritance is used if one class is a type of another class. For instance, if there is a Rectangle class and a Square class to represent rectangles and squares, since a square is a rectangle, it would make sense for the Square class to inherit the Rectangle class since they share some properties!\n\nInheritance is also used if there is a base class with methods and variables that are used by many classes but then the derived classes have some specific methods and variables unique to them. This saves code writing time since you only need to write common methods and variables once in the base class!\n\nTo inherit from a class, use the : symbol. For example, if I have a class Vehicle and I want the class Car to inherit from the class vehicle, I would define the classes as follows:\n\nclass Vehicle { \u2026 }\n\nclass Car : public Vehicle { \u2026 }\n\nThere are many useful applications of inheritance, and inheritance is one of the key elements of object oriented programming! \n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

This means once a return statement is reached, the function does not execute any other lines of code and sends the specified value back to the caller. For instance, a sqrt(x) function would return the square root of x so you could use the following syntax:\n\ny = sqrt(x)\n\nWhere y now holds the returned value from sqrt(x).\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

You must resolve this merge conflict with a new commit before you can merge these branches.\n\n1. Open Terminal.\n\n2. Navigate into the local Git repository that has the merge conflict.\n\n3. Generate a list of the files affected by the merge conflict using the command git status\n\n4. Open your favorite text editor, such as Visual Studio Code, and navigate to the file that has merge conflicts.\n\n5. To see the beginning of the merge conflict in your file, search the file for the conflict marker <<<<<<<. When you open the file in your text editor, you'll see the changes from the HEAD or base branch after the line <<<<<<< HEAD. Next, you'll see =======, which divides your changes from the changes in the other branch, followed by >>>>>>> BRANCH-NAME. In this example, one person wrote \"open an issue\" in the base or HEAD branch and another person wrote \"ask your question in IRC\" in the compare branch or branch-a.\n\nIf you have questions, please\n<<<<<<< HEAD\nopen an issue\n=======\nask your question in IRC.\n>>>>>>> branch-a\n\n6. Decide if you want to keep only your branch's changes, keep only the other branch's changes, or make a brand new change, which may incorporate changes from both branches. Delete the conflict markers <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>> and make the changes you want in the final merge. In this example, both changes are incorporated into the final merge:\n\n7. Add and commit your new file!\n\n\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Every computer has an internal hard drive, but you can also get external hard drives that can be used to expand the storage of a computer. \n\nSSDs (solid state drives) are the newer of the type of hard drive. They have become the preferred format for high-end laptops\u2019 internal hard drives, and all smartphones and tablets also use a form of SSD.\n\nSolid-state drives use flash memory, which is also what\u2019s used in USB flash drives and memory cards for digital cameras. There are no magnets involved here, SSDs use semiconductors that store data by altering the electrical state of the trillions of circuits contained within the SSD. Because they have no moving parts, not only do they work faster (as you don\u2019t need to wait for disks to spin and heads to gather information), they also tend to last longer than HDDs.\n\nSDDs are a lot more expensive to manufacture, so while they\u2019re increasingly prevalent as the primary disk drive for high-end laptops and PCs, hard disk drives are still preferred by many as a cheaper external option.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

This compiler error indicates something that must be fixed before the code can be compiled. All these errors are detected by the compiler and thus are known as compile-time errors. \nRun-time Error - Errors which occur during program execution(run-time) after successful compilation are called run-time errors. One of the most common run-time errors is division by zero also known as Division error. These types of error are hard to find as the compiler doesn\u2019t point to the line at which the error occurs. \nLinker Error - This error occurs when after compilation we link the different object files with main\u2019s object using Ctrl+F9 key(RUN). These are errors generated when the executable of the program cannot be generated. This may be due to wrong function prototyping, incorrect header files. One of the most common linker errors is writing Main() instead of main(). \nLogical Error - On compilation and execution of a program, desired output is not obtained when certain input values are given. These types of errors which provide incorrect output but appear to be error free are called logical errors. These are one of the most common errors made by beginners of programming. \nSemantic Error - This error occurs when the statements written in the program are not meaningful to the compiler.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

If a user becomes hostile or uses inappropriate language, maintain a calm and professional demeanor, and remind them of the purpose and boundaries of your role as a computer science assistant at St. Olaf College.\n\n## User\nWhere are files located?<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\nWhen we specify a file or directory on the command line (in the terminal, that is, in the shell) we can do so in two ways.  We can give the name in a form that is always going to be the same, regardless of what we have done before, like this:\n\n   ~/sd\n\nIn this pathname, we are using the ~ to represent the (absolute) path to the home directory, and then, within that, we are referring to the sd subdirectory.  Some other examples of absolute pathnames would be:\n\n  ~/sd/hw01/daily.cpp\n  ~/cs2\n  /usr/local/cs/cs251\n\nAnything that starts with ~ or / will be an absolute pathname.\n\nOn the other hand, we can also specify relative path names, that is, names that are relative to our current location in the file system.  Say for example that, when we first logged in, we want to go to our hw01 directory, like this (using an absolute pathname):\n\n  cd ~/sd/hw01\n\nIf we wanted to go to the hw02 directory, we could do so with a relative pathname like this:\n\n  cd ../hw02\n\nThe .. means the parent directory, which, in this case, is the sd directory, and the hw02 subdirectory is assumed to be inside it.  From there, if we wanted to go to the cs2 directory, we could use another relative pathname, like this:\n\n  cd ../../cs2\n\nIn this case, the parent of the parent of the current directory is the home directory, and the cs2 directory is found within it.\n\nIf we say something like:\n\n  cd sd\n\nThen that is a relative pathname, so it will only work if we are already in a directory that has a subdirectory named sd.  So if we are in the home directory, the command \"cd sd\" will work fine, but otherwise not.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Whenever you get a segfault you know you are doing something wrong with memory \u2013 accessing a variable that has already been freed, writing to a read-only portion of the memory, etc.\n\nA few common ways to get a segmentation fault is to dereference a null pointer, try to write to a portion of the memory marked as read-only (i.e. using char or const in the pointer declaration), use dangling pointers, meaning a pointer points to something that no longer exists (this usually happens when pointers are declared and used in different scopes), or improperly allocate and free dynamic memory.\n\nHere is a list of steps to take to try and resolve a segmentation fault:\n\n1. Check that you are not trying to modify a string literal. This means you are trying to modify a string that was declared using char, making it read only. If this is the case, either remove char from the declaration or do not attempt to modify the string.\n\n2. Check if you are trying to access an address that has been freed. For instance, if you have allocated something in dynamic memory and then deleted it, you cannot try to access it again. Similarly, if you are using dynamic memory and have forgotten to call delete once you are done with it, this can also cause a segmentation fault.\n\n3. Are you accessing an out-of-bounds array index? In C and C++, there is no array bounds checking, so if you have an array of four items and try to access an element at position 6, a segmentation fault can occur. Many times a program tries to access an element in an array that is just beyond the bounds of an array, usually due to an error in a loop declaration.\n\n4. It may be due to stack overflow. While this is not a common problem, this can occur if you run out of memory in your stack. It is also a type of memory corruption that may happen due to large array size, a large number of recursive calls, lots of local variables, etc. This segmentation fault may be raised even if you don\u2019t have any pointers in your code.\n\n5. You may also receive a segmentation fault due to buffer overflows. If the data being stored in the buffer is larger than the allocated size of the buffer, a buffer overflow occurs which leads to the segmentation fault. Most of the methods in the C language do not perform bound checking, so buffer overflow happens frequently when we forget to allot the required size to the buffer.\n\n6. If you try to dereference a null or uninitialized pointer you will also get a segmentation fault.\n\n7. If using dynamic memory, remember that for every new call there should be a corresponding delete call!<end_of_turn><eos>"}

The most important of them is hiding implementation details. A structure will by default not hide its implementation details from whoever uses it in code, while a class by default hides all its implementation details and will therefore by default prevent the programmer from accessing them. The other major difference between a class and a struct is what they are used for. A class is normally used for data abstraction and inheritance (classes can inherit other classes) whereas structs are mainly used for data grouping. Structs cannot inherit other structs. Classes are not possible to use in C, only in C++, but are generally preferred to structs since they are the key of object oriented programming.<end_of_turn><eos>"}

The most important of them is hiding implementation details. A structure will by default not hide its implementation details from whoever uses it in code, while a class by default hides all its implementation details and will therefore by default prevent the programmer from accessing them. The other major difference between a class and a struct is what they are used for. A class is normally used for data abstraction and inheritance (classes can inherit other classes) whereas structs are mainly used for data grouping. Structs cannot inherit other structs. Classes are not possible to use in C, only in C++, but are generally preferred to structs since they are the key of object oriented programming.<end_of_turn><eos>"}

This is useful when the size of an array is not known before the execution of a program. \n\nThe new operator is a unary operator used to dynamically allocate a block of memory and keep its address in a pointer variable at some point during the execution of a program. In other words, this operator is like a request for memory allocation on the heap memory (or the free store). And if sufficient memory is available, the dynamic space is initialized to the newly created variable or pointer.\n\nWhat happens once we do not need the variable that we've got declared dynamically? Well, we must deallocate the space in memory occupied by means of the variable.\nFor this, we use the delete operator and deallocate the block of memory that was dynamically allotted with the use of the new operator. In view of that, a programmer must de-allocate a block of memory, as soon as it is not required within the program or code or it will lead to memory leaks/segmentation faults. So, we require the delete operator to avoid memory leaks (i.e. segmentation faults). \n\nFor every use of the \u201cnew\u201d keyword there should be a use of the \u201cdelete\u201d keyword.\n\nThe new operator is a unary operator used to dynamically allocate a block of memory and keep its address in a pointer variable at some point during the execution of a program.

This compiler error indicates something that must be fixed before the code can be compiled. All these errors are detected by the compiler and thus are known as compile-time errors. \nRun-time Error - Errors which occur during program execution(run-time) after successful compilation are called run-time errors. One of the most common run-time errors is division by zero also known as Division error. These types of error are hard to find as the compiler doesn\u2019t point to the line at which the error occurs. \nLinker Error - This error occurs when after compilation we link the different object files with main\u2019s object using Ctrl+F9 key(RUN). These are errors generated when the executable of the program cannot be generated. This may be due to wrong function prototyping, incorrect header files. One of the most common linker errors is writing Main() instead of main(). \nLogical Error - On compilation and execution of a program, desired output is not obtained when certain input values are given. These types of errors which provide incorrect output but appear to be error free are called logical errors. These are one of the most common errors made by beginners of programming. \nSemantic Error - This error occurs when the statements written in the program are not meaningful to the compiler.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Also, it takes a long time to check them. This means if a solution for an NP-hard problem is given then it takes a long time to check whether it is right or not. Finally, a problem A is in NP-hard if, for every problem L in NP, there exists a polynomial-time reduction from L to A.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

For basic linking, you can just include multiple files in the g++ compile command like this:\n\ng++ foo1.cpp foo2.cpp\n\nThis produces an executable file a.out where you can use ./a.out to run it. However, we generally use the following method for linking more files as it means a change in one file does not mean every file needs to be recompiled. To do this, you create .o files for each cpp/header file and then link them together. An example is shown here: \n\ng++ -c foo1.cpp\ng++ -c foo2.cpp\ng++ -o foo foo1.o foo2.o\n\nThis produces an executable file foo where you use ./foo to run it. If you made a change to foo2.cpp, you would only need to rerun:\n\ng++ -c foo2.cpp\ng++ -o foo foo1.o foo2.o\n\nsince no changes were made to foo1.cpp so foo1.o remains the same.\n\ng++ foo1.cpp foo2.cpp\n\nThis produces an executable file a.out where you can use ./a.out to run it. For more advanced linking, i.e. to create .o files for each cpp/header file and then link them together, you can use the following command:\n\ng++ -c foo1.cpp\ng++ -c foo2.cpp\ng++ -o foo foo1.o foo2.o\n\nThis produces an executable file foo where you use ./foo to run it.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

NP problems are a class of computational problems that can be solved in polynomial time by a non-deterministic machine and can be verified in polynomial time by a deterministic Machine. A problem L in NP is NP-complete if all other problems in NP can be reduced to L in polynomial time. If any NP-complete problem can be solved in polynomial time, then every problem in NP can be solved in polynomial time. NP-complete problems are the hardest problems in the NP set.\nA decision problem L is NP-complete if it follow the below two properties: \n\nL is in NP (Any solution to NP-complete problems can be checked quickly, but no efficient solution is known). \n\nEvery problem in NP is reducible to L in polynomial time. \n\nA problem is NP-Hard if it obeys the second property above and need not obey the first. Therefore, a problem is NP-complete if it is both NP and NP-hard.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

For instance, in Python if you are using the square root function and pass a negative number as an argument, you will get a value error. While a negative number is still a number (and thus the correct type), you cannot take the square root of a negative number. To fix a value error, check what your functions are doing and if it can handle the arguments you pass to it.<end_of_turn><eos>"}

You must resolve this merge conflict with a new commit before you can merge these branches.\n\n1. Open Terminal.\n\n2. Navigate into the local Git repository that has the merge conflict.\n\n3. Generate a list of the files affected by the merge conflict using the command git status\n\n4. Open your favorite text editor, such as Visual Studio Code, and navigate to the file that has merge conflicts.\n\n5. To see the beginning of the merge conflict in your file, search the file for the conflict marker <<<<<<<. When you open the file in your text editor, you'll see the changes from the HEAD or base branch after the line <<<<<<< HEAD. Next, you'll see =======, which divides your changes from the changes in the other branch, followed by >>>>>>> BRANCH-NAME. In this example, one person wrote \"open an issue\" in the base or HEAD branch and another person wrote \"ask your question in IRC\" in the compare branch or branch-a.\n\nIf you have questions, please\n<<<<<<< HEAD\nopen an issue\n=======\nask your question in IRC.\n>>>>>>> branch-a\n\n6. Decide if you want to keep only your branch's changes, keep only the other branch's changes, or make a brand new change, which may incorporate changes from both branches. Delete the conflict markers <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>> and make the changes you want in the final merge. In this example, both changes are incorporated into the final merge:\n\n7. Add and commit your new file!\n\n\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

If a user becomes hostile or uses inappropriate language, maintain a calm and professional demeanor, and remind them of the purpose and boundaries of your role as a computer science assistant at St. Olaf College.\n\n## User\nHow do absolute and relative file paths differ from each other?<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\nWhen we specify a file or directory on the command line (in the terminal, that is, in the shell) we can do so in two ways.  We can give the name in a form that is always going to be the same, regardless of what we have done before, like this:\n\n   ~/sd\n\nIn this pathname, we are using the ~ to represent the (absolute) path to the home directory, and then, within that, we are referring to the sd subdirectory.  Some other examples of absolute pathnames would be:\n\n  ~/sd/hw01/daily.cpp\n  ~/cs2\n  /usr/local/cs/cs251\n\nAnything that starts with ~ or / will be an absolute pathname.\n\nOn the other hand, we can also specify relative path names, that is, names that are relative to our current location in the file system.  Say for example that, when we first logged in, we want to go to our hw01 directory, like this (using an absolute pathname):\n\n  cd ~/sd/hw01\n\nIf we wanted to go to the hw02 directory, we could do so with a relative pathname like this:\n\n  cd ../hw02\n\nThe .. means the parent directory, which, in this case, is the sd directory, and the hw02 subdirectory is assumed to be inside it.  From there, if we wanted to go to the cs2 directory, we could use another relative pathname, like this:\n\n  cd ../../cs2\n\nIn this case, the parent of the parent of the current directory is the home directory, and the cs2 directory is found within it.\n\nIf we say something like:\n\n  cd sd\n\nThen that is a relative pathname, so it will only work if we are already in a directory that has a subdirectory named sd.  So if we are in the home directory, the command \"cd sd\" will work fine, but otherwise not.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

For example, the <iostream> header file in C++ contains the definition of input-output functions.\n\nHeader files are used in C++ so that you don\u2019t have to write the code for every single thing. It helps to reduce the complexity and number of lines of code. It also gives you the benefit of reusing the functions that are declared in header files to different .cpp files and including a header file is way easier than writing the implementations. By using a header file, you keep the program precise and focused, which makes it manageable.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

We group the \"inheritance concept\" into two categories:\n\nderived class (child) - the class that inherits from another class\nbase class (parent) - the class being inherited from\n\nUsually inheritance is used if one class is a type of another class. For instance, if there is a Rectangle class and a Square class to represent rectangles and squares, since a square is a rectangle, it would make sense for the Square class to inherit the Rectangle class since they share some properties!\n\nInheritance is also used if there is a base class with methods and variables that are used by many classes but then the derived classes have some specific methods and variables unique to them. This saves code writing time since you only need to write common methods and variables once in the base class!\n\nTo inherit from a class, use the : symbol. For example, if I have a class Vehicle and I want the class Car to inherit from the class vehicle, I would define the classes as follows:\n\nclass Vehicle { \u2026 }\n\nclass Car : public Vehicle { \u2026 }\n\nThere are many useful applications of inheritance, and inheritance is one of the key elements of object oriented programming! \n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.\n\nOOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained. This includes programs for manufacturing and design, as well as mobile applications; for example, OOP can be used for manufacturing system simulation software.\n\nThe organization of an object-oriented program also makes the method beneficial to collaborative development, where projects are divided into groups. Additional benefits of OOP include code reusability, scalability and efficiency.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

We group the \"inheritance concept\" into two categories:\n\nderived class (child) - the class that inherits from another class\nbase class (parent) - the class being inherited from\n\nUsually inheritance is used if one class is a type of another class. For instance, if there is a Rectangle class and a Square class to represent rectangles and squares, since a square is a rectangle, it would make sense for the Square class to inherit the Rectangle class since they share some properties!\n\nInheritance is also used if there is a base class with methods and variables that are used by many classes but then the derived classes have some specific methods and variables unique to them. This saves code writing time since you only need to write common methods and variables once in the base class!\n\nTo inherit from a class, use the : symbol. For example, if I have a class Vehicle and I want the class Car to inherit from the class vehicle, I would define the classes as follows:\n\nclass Vehicle { \u2026 }\n\nclass Car : public Vehicle { \u2026 }\n\nThere are many useful applications of inheritance, and inheritance is one of the key elements of object oriented programming! \n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

It is used to access the public members of a class, structure, or members of a union with the help of a pointer variable.\n\nThere is a .(dot) operator in C++ that is also used to access the members of a class. But .(dot operator) accesses the member or variable directly without using the pointers whereas instead of accessing members directly the arrow operator(->) in C++ uses a pointer to access them. So the advantage of the -> operator is that it can deal with both pointer and non-pointer access but the dot(.) operator can only be used to access the members of a class.\n\nArrow (->) operator in C++ represents the same meaning which is done by the (*) asterisk operator and dot(.) operator. Arrow operator can be written in a different way which is using the combination of two operators *.. For example, (*s).element is the same as s->element. The brackets (parenthesis) used while using the combination of (*.) operators show that the precedence of the dot(.) operator is more than *.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

While a negative number is still a number (and thus the correct type), you cannot take the square root of a negative number. To fix a value error, check what your functions are doing and if it can handle the arguments you pass to it.<end_of_turn><eos>"}

It is used to access the public members of a class, structure, or members of a union with the help of a pointer variable.\n\nThere is a .(dot) operator in C++ that is also used to access the members of a class. But .(dot operator) accesses the member or variable directly without using the pointers whereas instead of accessing members directly the arrow operator(->) in C++ uses a pointer to access them. So the advantage of the -> operator is that it can deal with both pointer and non-pointer access but the dot(.) operator can only be used to access the members of a class.\n\nArrow (->) operator in C++ represents the same meaning which is done by the (*) asterisk operator and dot(.) operator. Arrow operator can be written in a different way which is using the combination of two operators *.. For example, (*s).element is the same as s->element. The brackets (parenthesis) used while using the combination of (*.) operators show that the precedence of the dot(.) operator is more than *.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

There are no magnets involved here, SSDs use semiconductors that store data by altering the electrical state of the trillions of circuits contained within the SSD. Because they have no moving parts, not only do they work faster (as you don\u2019t need to wait for disks to spin and heads to gather information), they also tend to last longer than HDDs.\n\nSDDs are a lot more expensive to manufacture, so while they\u2019re increasingly prevalent as the primary disk drive for high-end laptops and PCs, hard disk drives are still preferred by many as a cheaper external option.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

This is useful when the size of an array is not known before the execution of a program. \n\nThe new operator is a unary operator used to dynamically allocate a block of memory and keep its address in a pointer variable at some point during the execution of a program. In other words, this operator is like a request for memory allocation on the heap memory (or the free store). And if sufficient memory is available, the dynamic space is initialized to the newly created variable or pointer.\n\nWhat happens once we do not need the variable that we've got declared dynamically? Well, we must deallocate the space in memory occupied by means of the variable.\nFor this, we use the delete operator and deallocate the block of memory that was dynamically allotted with the use of the new operator. In view of that, a programmer must de-allocate a block of memory, as soon as it is not required within the program or code or it will lead to memory leaks/segmentation faults. So, we require the delete operator to avoid memory leaks (i.e. segmentation faults). \n\nFor every use of the \u201cnew\u201d keyword there should be a use of the \u201cdelete\u201d keyword.\n\nThe new operator is a unary operator used to dynamically allocate a block of memory and keep its address in a pointer variable at some point during the execution of a program.

The most important of them is hiding implementation details. A structure will by default not hide its implementation details from whoever uses it in code, while a class by default hides all its implementation details and will therefore by default prevent the programmer from accessing them. The other major difference between a class and a struct is what they are used for. A class is normally used for data abstraction and inheritance (classes can inherit other classes) whereas structs are mainly used for data grouping. Structs cannot inherit other structs. Classes are not possible to use in C, only in C++, but are generally preferred to structs since they are the key of object oriented programming.<end_of_turn><eos>"}

They have become the preferred format for high-end laptops\u2019 internal hard drives, and all smartphones and tablets also use a form of SSD.\n\nSolid-state drives use flash memory, which is also what\u2019s used in USB flash drives and memory cards for digital cameras. There are no magnets involved here, SSDs use semiconductors that store data by altering the electrical state of the trillions of circuits contained within the SSD. Because they have no moving parts, not only do they work faster (as you don\u2019t need to wait for disks to spin and heads to gather information), they also tend to last longer than HDDs.\n\nSDDs are a lot more expensive to manufacture, so while they\u2019re increasingly prevalent as the primary disk drive for high-end laptops and PCs, hard disk drives are still preferred by many as a cheaper external option.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

It is also inside many file transfer tools and configuration management tools. Every major corporation uses it, in every data center.\n\nSSH keys enable the automation that makes modern cloud services and other computer-dependent services possible and cost-effective. They offer convenience and improved security when properly managed.\n\nFunctionally SSH keys resemble passwords. They grant access and control who can access what. In identity and access management, they need similar policies, provisioning, and termination as user accounts and passwords. One cannot have confidentiality, integrity, or any guarantees of continued availability of systems without controlling SSH keys.\n\nTechnically the keys are cryptographic keys using a public key cryptosystem. However, functionally they are authentication credentials and need to be managed as such.<end_of_turn><eos>"}

We group the \"inheritance concept\" into two categories:\n\nderived class (child) - the class that inherits from another class\nbase class (parent) - the class being inherited from\n\nUsually inheritance is used if one class is a type of another class. For instance, if there is a Rectangle class and a Square class to represent rectangles and squares, since a square is a rectangle, it would make sense for the Square class to inherit the Rectangle class since they share some properties!\n\nInheritance is also used if there is a base class with methods and variables that are used by many classes but then the derived classes have some specific methods and variables unique to them. This saves code writing time since you only need to write common methods and variables once in the base class!\n\nTo inherit from a class, use the : symbol. For example, if I have a class Vehicle and I want the class Car to inherit from the class vehicle, I would define the classes as follows:\n\nclass Vehicle { \u2026 }\n\nclass Car : public Vehicle { \u2026 }\n\nThere are many useful applications of inheritance, and inheritance is one of the key elements of object oriented programming! \n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

When we are out of space, we'll often see a * next to the number.\n\nThe following command (entered into a terminal on a cs lab machine) will help identify where the quota is being used:\n\n  du -m ~ | sort -n\n\nThis command will show the disk usage, in megabytes, for all the directories inside your home directory, sorted numerically.\n\nYou may find that vscode is using a lot of disk space for temporary files.  Feel free to get rid of vscode directories.  For example:\n\n  cd ~/.cache/vscode-cpptools/\n  rm -rf ipch\n\nBe careful with \"rm -rf\"-- there is no undo!\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Well, we must deallocate the space in memory occupied by means of the variable.\nFor this, we use the delete operator and deallocate the block of memory that was dynamically allotted with the use of the new operator. In view of that, a programmer must de-allocate a block of memory, as soon as it is not required within the program or code or it will lead to memory leaks/segmentation faults. So, we require the delete operator to avoid memory leaks (i.e. segmentation faults). \n\nFor every use of the \u201cnew\u201d keyword there should be a use of the \u201cdelete\u201d keyword.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

NP problems are a class of computational problems that can be solved in polynomial time by a non-deterministic machine and can be verified in polynomial time by a deterministic Machine. A problem L in NP is NP-complete if all other problems in NP can be reduced to L in polynomial time. If any NP-complete problem can be solved in polynomial time, then every problem in NP can be solved in polynomial time. NP-complete problems are the hardest problems in the NP set.\nA decision problem L is NP-complete if it follow the below two properties: \n\nL is in NP (Any solution to NP-complete problems can be checked quickly, but no efficient solution is known). \n\nEvery problem in NP is reducible to L in polynomial time. \n\nA problem is NP-Hard if it obeys the second property above and need not obey the first. Therefore, a problem is NP-complete if it is both NP and NP-hard.\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}

Check if your machine\u2019s SSH service is down. You can do that by entering the following\n\nsudo service status ssh\n\nIf the command line returns that the ssh service is down, that is most likely your error. To solve it, research how to enable SSH on Mac/Windows/Linux depending on the operating system your personal computer is running.\n\n2. You may be using the wrong credentials. Double check that the hostname, your username and your password are all typed correctly. For connecting to link machines, the hostname should follow the form: rns20[2-3]-[1-20].cs.stolaf.edu where in each set of brackets you pick a number in the range and then omit the brackets from the hostname.\n\n3. If the above steps do not work, try the following. On your personal machine, enter the following command:\n\nssh -Q mac\n\nA list will print. One potential output looks something like: hmac-sha1. Next, instead of running the standard ssh command, run this command instead, using the first entry in the list you just generated:\n\nssh -m [first entry from list] username@rns20[2-3]-[1-20].cs.stolaf.edu\n\nWhere everything in brackets is replaced and the brackets are not included in the command.
