How do I fix the disk quota issue?,"We all have a limited amount of disk space we are allowed to use in our home directories.  To see the current usage, type the following into a terminal:

  quota -s

The first number is the space used, the second is the limit.  When we are out of space, we'll often see a * next to the number.

The following command (entered into a terminal on a cs lab machine) will help identify where the quota is being used:

  du -m ~ | sort -n

This command will show the disk usage, in megabytes, for all the directories inside your home directory, sorted numerically.

You may find that vscode is using a lot of disk space for temporary files.  Feel free to get rid of vscode directories.  For example:

  cd ~/.cache/vscode-cpptools/
  rm -rf ipch

Be careful with ""rm -rf""-- there is no undo!

What is the difference between absolute and relative file paths?,"When we specify a file or directory on the command line (in the terminal, that is, in the shell) we can do so in two ways.  We can give the name in a form that is always going to be the same, regardless of what we have done before, like this:

   ~/sd

In this pathname, we are using the ~ to represent the (absolute) path to the home directory, and then, within that, we are referring to the sd subdirectory.  Some other examples of absolute pathnames would be:

  ~/sd/hw01/daily.cpp
  ~/cs2
  /usr/local/cs/cs251

Anything that starts with ~ or / will be an absolute pathname.

On the other hand, we can also specify relative path names, that is, names that are relative to our current location in the file system.  Say for example that, when we first logged in, we want to go to our hw01 directory, like this (using an absolute pathname):

  cd ~/sd/hw01

If we wanted to go to the hw02 directory, we could do so with a relative pathname like this:

  cd ../hw02

The .. means the parent directory, which, in this case, is the sd directory, and the hw02 subdirectory is assumed to be inside it.  From there, if we wanted to go to the cs2 directory, we could use another relative pathname, like this:

  cd ../../cs2

In this case, the parent of the parent of the current directory is the home directory, and the cs2 directory is found within it.

If we say something like:

  cd sd

Then that is a relative pathname, so it will only work if we are already in a directory that has a subdirectory named sd.  So if we are in the home directory, the command ""cd sd"" will work fine, but otherwise not.

What is an absolute path?,"When we specify a file or directory on the command line (in the terminal, that is, in the shell) we can do so in two ways.  We can give the name in a form that is always going to be the same, regardless of what we have done before, like this:

   ~/sd

In this pathname, we are using the ~ to represent the (absolute) path to the home directory, and then, within that, we are referring to the sd subdirectory.  Some other examples of absolute pathnames would be:

  ~/sd/hw01/daily.cpp
  ~/cs2
  /usr/local/cs/cs251

Anything that starts with ~ or / will be an absolute pathname.

On the other hand, we can also specify relative path names, that is, names that are relative to our current location in the file system.  Say for example that, when we first logged in, we want to go to our hw01 directory, like this (using an absolute pathname):

  cd ~/sd/hw01

If we wanted to go to the hw02 directory, we could do so with a relative pathname like this:

  cd ../hw02

The .. means the parent directory, which, in this case, is the sd directory, and the hw02 subdirectory is assumed to be inside it.  From there, if we wanted to go to the cs2 directory, we could use another relative pathname, like this:

  cd ../../cs2

In this case, the parent of the parent of the current directory is the home directory, and the cs2 directory is found within it.

If we say something like:

  cd sd

Then that is a relative pathname, so it will only work if we are already in a directory that has a subdirectory named sd.  So if we are in the home directory, the command ""cd sd"" will work fine, but otherwise not.

What does the find terminal command do?,"find - Allows you to search your computer for a specific file (by filename, user, or other operands), either from the root directory (meaning it will examine every file) or in a directory you specify.

Two common operands to use with find:

-name: Find files matching a specific name pattern
-type: Find files matching a specific type (pass b for block special file, c for character special file, d for directory, l for symbolic link, p for FIFO, f for regular file, and s for socket).

More operands can be found by researching find or using the command man find.

Example usage:

Find the file homework.txt, searching your home directory: 
find ~ -name homework.txt

Find the file homework.txt, searching the root directory:
find / -name homework.txt

Find the file homework.txt, searching your cs221 directory (and any subdirectories within it):
find ~/cs221 -name homework.txt

Find all .cpp files in your cs221 directory:
find ~/cs221 -name *.cpp

For more information on the wildcard (*), research regex wildcards.

Where should I look to find my homework?,"find - Allows you to search your computer for a specific file (by filename, user, or other operands), either from the root directory (meaning it will examine every file) or in a directory you specify.

Two common operands to use with find:

-name: Find files matching a specific name pattern
-type: Find files matching a specific type (pass b for block special file, c for character special file, d for directory, l for symbolic link, p for FIFO, f for regular file, and s for socket).

More operands can be found by researching find or using the command man find.

Example usage:

Find the file homework.txt, searching your home directory: 
find ~ -name homework.txt

Find the file homework.txt, searching the root directory:
find / -name homework.txt

How do I push to git?,"If you would like to push files to git, there are a few steps. The first step is to add your files to be committed. You can do this by entering the following command:

git add [filenames, separated by spaces] 

Then, you need to commit your files by entering the following command:

git commit -m “some message”

Make sure to include a commit message in quotations after the -m. This message should be related to the files you are changing, such as “updated file1” or “hw01 submission.”

Next, make sure the link machine/your personal computer is up to date with the repository by pulling from the repository. You can do this by running the following command:

git pull origin main

If you are working with a different git branch, you can use git pull origin [branch].

If that command is successful, then you can push to git using the following command:

git push origin main

What is SSH?,"SSH (Secure Shell) is used for managing networks, operating systems, and configurations. It is also inside many file transfer tools and configuration management tools. Every major corporation uses it, in every data center.

SSH keys enable the automation that makes modern cloud services and other computer-dependent services possible and cost-effective. They offer convenience and improved security when properly managed.

Functionally SSH keys resemble passwords. They grant access and control who can access what. In identity and access management, they need similar policies, provisioning, and termination as user accounts and passwords.

How to fix SSH connection refused error,"1. Check if your machine’s SSH service is down. You can do that by entering the following

sudo service status ssh

If the command line returns that the ssh service is down, that is most likely your error. To solve it, research how to enable SSH on Mac/Windows/Linux depending on the operating system your personal computer is running.

2. You may be using the wrong credentials. Double check that the hostname, your username and your password are all typed correctly. For connecting to link machines, the hostname should follow the form: rns20[2-3]-[1-20].cs.stolaf.edu where in each set of brackets you pick a number in the range and then omit the brackets from the hostname.

3. If the above steps do not work, try the following. On your personal machine, enter the following command:

ssh -Q mac

A list will print. One potential output looks something like: hmac-sha1. Next, instead of running the standard ssh command, run this command instead, using the first entry in the list you just generated:

ssh -m [first entry from list] username@rns20[2-3]-[1-20].cs.stolaf.edu

Where everything in brackets is replaced and the brackets are not included in the command. Repeat the above command with other entries in the list you generated until one of them works.

What is a while loop?,"A while loop is a control flow statement which repeatedly executes a block of code until the condition is satisfied. It stops executing the block only if the condition fails. One should use a 'while' loop when one needs to perform a repeated operation, but doesn't know in advance how many iterations would be needed.

For example, in Python, you could write a while loop like this:

i = 1

How do I resolve merge conflicts?,"To resolve a merge conflict caused by competing line changes, you must choose which changes to incorporate from the different branches in a new commit.

For example, if you and another person both edited the file styleguide.md on the same lines in different branches of the same Git repository, you'll get a merge conflict error when you try to merge these branches. You must resolve this merge conflict with a new commit before you can merge these branches.

1. Open Terminal.

2. Navigate into the local Git repository that has the merge conflict.

3. Generate a list of the files affected by the merge conflict using the command git status

4. Open your favorite text editor, such as Visual Studio Code, and navigate to the file that has merge conflicts.

5. To see the beginning of the merge conflict in your file, search the file for the conflict marker <<<<<<<. When you open the file in your text editor, you'll see the changes from the HEAD or base branch after the line <<<<<<< HEAD. Next, you'll see =======, which divides your changes from the changes in the other branch, followed by >>>>>>> BRANCH-NAME. In this example, one person wrote ""open an issue"" in the base or HEAD branch and another person wrote ""ask your question in IRC"" in the compare branch or branch-a.

If you have questions, please
<<<<<<< HEAD

What is object oriented programming?,"Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained. This includes programs for manufacturing and design, as well as mobile applications; for example, OOP can be used for manufacturing system simulation software.

The organization of an object-oriented program also makes the method beneficial to collaborative development, where projects are divided into groups. Additional benefits of OOP include code reusability, scalability and efficiency.

How is object-oriented programming described within the realm of computer science?,"Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained. This includes programs for manufacturing and design, as well as mobile applications; for example, OOP can be used for manufacturing system simulation software.

How to fix a syntax error?,"A SyntaxError occurs in a language when the interpreter is unable to parse the code due to the code violating languages language rules, such as inappropriate indentation, erroneous keyword usage, or incorrect operator use. Syntax errors prohibit the code from running, and the interpreter displays an error message that specifies the problem and where it occurred in the code.

The syntax error will point out where the error occurred–for instance it may say in line two unexpected ‘:’ which means there should not be a colon there. Many times it gives a suggestion of something is missing as well. So read the error closely–most likely the solution is given to you in the error!

What is a segmentation fault?,"A Segmentation fault is a specific kind of error caused by accessing memory that “does not belong to you.” It’s a helper mechanism that keeps you from corrupting the memory and introducing hard-to-debug memory bugs. Whenever you get a segfault you know you are doing something wrong with memory – accessing a variable that has already been freed, writing to a read-only portion of the memory, etc.

A few common ways to get a segmentation fault is to dereference a null pointer, try to write to a portion of the memory marked as read-only (i.e. using char or const in the pointer declaration), use dangling pointers, meaning a pointer points to something that no longer exists (this usually happens when pointers are declared and used in different scopes), or improperly allocate and free dynamic memory.

Here is a list of steps to take to try and resolve a segmentation fault:

1. Check that you are not trying to modify a string literal. This means you are trying to modify a string that was declared using char, making it read only. If this is the case, either remove char from the declaration or do not attempt to modify the string.

2. Check if you are trying to access an address that has been freed. For instance, if you have allocated something in dynamic memory and then deleted it, you cannot try to access it again. Similarly, if you are using dynamic memory and have forgotten to call delete once you are done with it, this can also cause a segmentation fault.

3. Are you accessing an out-of-bounds array index? In C and C++, there is no array bounds checking, so if you have an array of four items and try to access an element at position 6, a segmentation fault can occur. Many times a program tries to access an element in an array that is just beyond the bounds of an array, usually due to an error in a loop declaration.

4. It may be due to stack overflow. While this is not a common problem, this can occur if you run out of memory in your stack. It is also a type of memory corruption that may happen due to large array size, a large number of recursive calls, lots of local variables, etc. This segmentation fault may be raised even if you don’t have any pointers in your code.

5. You may also receive a segmentation fault due to buffer overflows. If the data being stored in the buffer is larger than the allocated size of the buffer, a buffer overflow occurs which leads to the segmentation fault. Most of the methods in the C language do not perform bound checking, so buffer overflow happens frequently when we forget to allot the required size to the buffer.

6. If you try to dereference a null or uninitialized pointer you will also get a segmentation fault.

7. If using dynamic memory, remember that for every new call there should be a corresponding delete call!",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segmentation-fault-c-cpp/

A few common ways to get a segmentation fault is to dereference a null pointer, try to write to a portion of the memory marked as read-only (i.e. using char or const in the pointer declaration), use dangling pointers, meaning a pointer points to something that no longer exists (this usually happens when pointers are declared and used in different scopes), or improperly allocate and free dynamic memory.

Here is a list of steps to take to try and resolve a segmentation fault:

1. Check that you are not trying to modify a string literal. This means you are trying to modify a string that was declared using char, making it read only. If this is the case, either remove char from the declaration or do not attempt to modify the string.

2. Check if you are trying to access an address that has been freed. For instance, if you have allocated something in dynamic memory and then deleted it, you cannot try to access it again. Similarly, if you are using dynamic memory and have forgotten to call delete once you are done with it, this can also cause a segmentation fault.

3. Are you accessing an out-of-bounds array index? In C and C++, there is no array bounds checking, so if you have an array of four items and try to access an element at position 6, a segmentation fault can occur. Many times a program tries to access an element in an array that is just beyond the bounds of an array, usually due to an error in a loop declaration.

4. It may be due to stack overflow. While this is not a common problem, this can occur if you run out of memory in your stack. It is also a type of memory corruption that may happen due to large array size, a large number of recursive calls, lots of local variables, etc. This segmentation fault may be raised even if you don’t have any pointers in your code.

5. You may also receive a segmentation fault due to buffer overflows. If the data being stored in the buffer is larger than the allocated size of the buffer, a buffer overflow occurs which leads to the segmentation fault. Most of the methods in the C language do not perform bound checking, so buffer overflow happens frequently when we forget to allot the required size to the buffer.

6. If you try to dereference a null or uninitialized pointer you will also get a segmentation fault.

How do I set up SSH in VSCode?,"The first step is to make sure you are either on campus using the eduroam network or using the St. Olaf VPN.

To be able to connect to the St. Olaf links machines with VSCode on your personal computer, you need to set up SSH. To start, open VSCode, and on the left side of the window open the extensions tab (the icon with four squares at the end of the list of icons).

In the search bar that appears in the extensions tab, search for “ssh.” Select “Remote - SSH” when it appears (it should be near the top and is created by Microsoft).

Install the extension, and follow any instructions during the installation process. Once it has been installed, quit and relaunch VSCode (just to make sure everything is configured correctly). You should now see a new icon above the extensions icon that has a screen with arrows in a circle. Select that icon. It will bring up the remote explorer tab (the icon looks like a computer with greater than and less than signs in the bottom right corner).

In the remote explorer tab, make sure SSH Targets is selected in the top dropdown menu and you see the SSH Targets list underneath. To add an SSH connection, hover over the SSH Targets list header, and then click the plus that appears to the right of that heading.

In the prompt that appears, type:

ssh username@rns20x-y.cs.stolaf.edu

where you replace username with your St. Olaf username, x with either 2 or 3 (for RNS 202 and 203), and y with a number in the range 1-27. These correspond to each link machine in RNS 202 and 203. Then hit enter. 

In the next screen that appears, just press enter again, you want to update your default SSH configuration profile.

After you have done that, you will see the host added in the remote explorer tab under SSH Targets.

Next, hover over the name of the host and you will see a little button appear to the right of the name that looks like a window with a plus. Click that button.

A new window will pop up. You may receive a prompt asking you to select the platform of the remote host. If so, select Linux. Also, if this is the first time you are connecting to the host, you will receive a prompt talking about a fingerprint. Select Continue. 

It will then ask you for your password (this is your St. Olaf password). 

Once you have entered your password, you can tell if you are connected to the link machine by looking in the bottom left corner and verifying that the name of the link machine is listed there.


If at any point you get a connection refused error, try the following steps:

Check if your machine’s SSH service is down. You can do that by entering the following sudo service status ssh If the command line returns that the ssh service is down, that is most likely your error. To solve it, research how to enable SSH on Mac/Windows/Linux depending on the operating system your personal computer is running. 

You may be using the wrong credentials. Double check that the hostname, your username and your password are all typed correctly. For connecting to link machines, the hostname should follow the form: 

rns20[2-3]-[1-20].cs.stolaf.edu 

where in each set of brackets you pick a number in the range and then omit the brackets from the hostname.

If the above steps do not work, try the following. On your personal machine, enter the following command: 

ssh -Q mac 

A list will print. One potential output looks something like: hmac-sha1. Next, instead of running the standard ssh command, run this command instead, using the first entry in the list you just generated: 

ssh -m [first entry from list] username@rns20[2-3]-[1-20].cs.stolaf.edu 

Where everything in brackets is replaced and the brackets are not included in the command. Repeat the above command with other entries in the list you generated until one of them works. To try with hmac-sha1 on the rns202-1 link machine, the command would be:

ssh -m hmac-sha1 username@rns202-1.cs.stolaf.edu

What's the procedure for enabling SSH in VSCode?,"The first step is to make sure you are either on campus using the eduroam network or using the St. Olaf VPN.

To be able to connect to the St. Olaf links machines with VSCode on your personal computer, you need to set up SSH. To start, open VSCode, and on the left side of the window open the extensions tab (the icon with four squares at the end of the list of icons).

In the search bar that appears in the extensions tab, search for “ssh.” Select “Remote - SSH” when it appears (it should be near the top and is created by Microsoft).

Install the extension, and follow any instructions during the installation process. Once it has been installed, quit and relaunch VSCode (just to make sure everything is configured correctly). You should now see a new icon above the extensions icon that has a screen with arrows in a circle. Select that icon. It will bring up the remote explorer tab (the icon looks like a computer with greater than and less than signs in the bottom right corner).

In the remote explorer tab, make sure SSH Targets is selected in the top dropdown menu and you see the SSH Targets list underneath. To add an SSH connection, hover over the SSH Targets list header, and then click the plus that appears to the right of that heading.

In the prompt that appears, type:

ssh username@rns20x-y.cs.stolaf.edu

where you replace username with your St. Olaf username, x with either 2 or 3 (for RNS 202 and 203), and y with a number in the range 1-27. These correspond to each link machine in RNS 202 and 203. Then hit enter. 

In the next screen that appears, just press enter again, you want to update your default SSH configuration profile.

After you have done that, you will see the host added in the remote explorer tab under SSH Targets.

Next, hover over the name of the host and you will see a little button appear to the right of the name that looks like a window with a plus. Click that button.

A new window will pop up. You may receive a prompt asking you to select the platform of the remote host. If so, select Linux. Also, if this is the first time you are connecting to the host, you will receive a prompt talking about a fingerprint. Select Continue. 

It will then ask you for your password (this is your St. Olaf password). 

Once you have entered your password, you can tell if you are connected to the link machine by looking in the bottom left corner and verifying that the name of the link machine is listed there.


If at any point you get a connection refused error, try the following steps:

Check if your machine’s SSH service is down. You can do that by entering the following sudo service status ssh If the command line returns that the ssh service is down, that is most likely your error. To solve it, research how to enable SSH on Mac/Windows/Linux depending on the operating system your personal computer is running. 

You may be using the wrong credentials. Double check that the hostname, your username and your password are all typed correctly. For connecting to link machines, the hostname should follow the form: 

rns20[2-3]-[1-20].cs.stolaf.edu 

where in each set of brackets you pick a number in the range and then omit the brackets from the hostname.

If the above steps do not work, try the following. On your personal machine, enter the following command: 

ssh -Q mac

For example, if you have written a function multiply(x, y) that multiplies two numbers x and y together, x and y are the parameters of the function. When you call the function multiply(2, 3), 2 and 3 are the arguments of the function.",
In what ways are parameters and arguments different?,"The values that are declared within a function when the function is called are known as an argument. Whereas, the variables that are defined when the function is declared are known as a parameter. For example, if you have written a function multiply(x, y) that multiplies two numbers x and y together, x and y are the parameters of the function.

What are some common errors in C++?,"The most common errors can be broadly classified as follows: 

Syntax Error - Errors that occur when you violate the rules of writing C/C++ syntax are known as syntax errors. This compiler error indicates something that must be fixed before the code can be compiled. All these errors are detected by the compiler and thus are known as compile-time errors. 
Run-time Error - Errors which occur during program execution(run-time) after successful compilation are called run-time errors. One of the most common run-time errors is division by zero also known as Division error. These types of error are hard to find as the compiler doesn’t point to the line at which the error occurs. 
Linker Error - This error occurs when after compilation we link the different object files with main’s object using Ctrl+F9 key(RUN). These are errors generated when the executable of the program cannot be generated. This may be due to wrong function prototyping, incorrect header files. One of the most common linker errors is writing Main() instead of main(). 
Logical Error - On compilation and execution of a program, desired output is not obtained when certain input values are given. These types of errors which provide incorrect output but appear to be error free are called logical errors. These are one of the most common errors made by beginners of programming. 
Semantic Error - This error occurs when the statements written in the program are not meaningful to the compiler.

To use cout, we must include namespace std in our program. Without it, we would have to write std::cout instead of cout in our code. In this article, we will cover cout in further detail. The syntax is:

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

cout << [variable to print]

How do I link files in C++?,"There are a two ways to do this. For basic linking, you can just include multiple files in the g++ compile command like this:

g++ foo1.cpp foo2.cpp

This produces an executable file a.out where you can use ./a.out to run it. However, we generally use the following method for linking more files as it means a change in one file does not mean every file needs to be recompiled. To do this, you create .o files for each cpp/header file and then link them together. An example is shown here: 

g++ -c foo1.cpp
g++ -c foo2.cpp
g++ -o foo foo1.o foo2.o

This produces an executable file foo where you use ./foo to run it. If you made a change to foo2.cpp, you would only need to rerun:

g++ -c foo2.cpp

This produces an executable file foo where you use ./foo to run it. If you made a change to foo2.cpp, you would only need to rerun:

g++ -c foo2.cpp
g++ -o foo foo1.o foo2.o

since no changes were made to foo1.cpp so foo1.o remains the same.

g++ foo1.cpp foo2.cpp

This produces an executable file a.out where you can use ./a.out to run it. For more advanced linking, i.e. to create .o files for each cpp/header file and then link them together, you can use the following command:

g++ -c foo1.cpp
g++ -c foo2.cpp
g++ -o foo foo1.o foo2.o

This produces an executable file foo where you use ./foo to run it.

What is the difference between C and C++?,"C focuses on procedural programming. It's about following specific steps or instructions. This involves using functions and structured techniques. Essentially, C revolves around functions and the order of program operations.
C++, in contrast, expands on C. It introduces object-oriented programming. This method uses classes and objects. These elements group related functions and data. This approach simplifies complex software design, understanding, and maintenance. The main difference between C and C++ is their approach. C is driven by functions and their execution sequence. C++, however, is based on OOP. It focuses on classes, objects and their interactions. This makes it more suited for handling complex software systems.

What is an inherited class?,"In C++, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the ""inheritance concept"" into two categories:

derived class (child) - the class that inherits from another class
base class (parent) - the class being inherited from

Usually inheritance is used if one class is a type of another class. For instance, if there is a Rectangle class and a Square class to represent rectangles and squares, since a square is a rectangle, it would make sense for the Square class to inherit the Rectangle class since they share some properties!

Inheritance is also used if there is a base class with methods and variables that are used by many classes but then the derived classes have some specific methods and variables unique to them. This saves code writing time since you only need to write common methods and variables once in the base class!

To inherit from a class, use the : symbol. For example, if I have a class Vehicle and I want the class Car to inherit from the class vehicle, I would define the classes as follows:

class Vehicle { … }

class Car : public Vehicle { … }

For instance, if there is a Rectangle class and a Square class to represent rectangles and squares, since a square is a rectangle, it would make sense for the Square class to inherit the Rectangle class since they share some properties!

Inheritance is also used if there is a base class with methods and variables that are used by many classes but then the derived classes have some specific methods and variables unique to them. This saves code writing time since you only need to write common methods and variables once in the base class!

To inherit from a class, use the : symbol. For example, if I have a class Vehicle and I want the class Car to inherit from the class vehicle, I would define the classes as follows:

class Vehicle { … }

class Car : public Vehicle { … }

There are many useful applications of inheritance, and inheritance is one of the key elements of object oriented programming!

Can you elaborate on the significance of class inheritance in programming languages?,"In C++, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the ""inheritance concept"" into two categories:

derived class (child) - the class that inherits from another class
base class (parent) - the class being inherited from

In essence, RAM is your computer or laptop’s short-term memory. It’s where the data is stored that your computer processor needs to run your applications and open your files.

Inside your computer, RAM typically comes in the form of a rectangular flat circuit board with memory chips attached, also referred to as a memory module. Computers typically come with at least two RAM modules with room to add more, if needed. These RAM modules are critical components that work hand in hand with your computer’s central processing unit (CPU) and must be working optimally for you to have a good experience.

What is an SSD?,"A hard drive is a piece of hardware used to store digital content and data on computers. Every computer has an internal hard drive, but you can also get external hard drives that can be used to expand the storage of a computer. 

SSDs (solid state drives) are the newer of the type of hard drive. They have become the preferred format for high-end laptops’ internal hard drives, and all smartphones and tablets also use a form of SSD.

Solid-state drives use flash memory, which is also what’s used in USB flash drives and memory cards for digital cameras. There are no magnets involved here, SSDs use semiconductors that store data by altering the electrical state of the trillions of circuits contained within the SSD. Because they have no moving parts, not only do they work faster (as you don’t need to wait for disks to spin and heads to gather information), they also tend to last longer than HDDs.

SDDs are a lot more expensive to manufacture, so while they’re increasingly prevalent as the primary disk drive for high-end laptops and PCs, hard disk drives are still preferred by many as a cheaper external option.

To put it simply, the operating system manages the communication between your software and your hardware. Without the operating system (OS), the software wouldn’t function.

There are many different variations of Linux called distros. One of the most popular ones is Ubuntu. Most distros are open source and free to use. Generally, Linux is the preferred operating system for software development and most programming tasks. The link machines run Linux for this reason!

What is dynamic memory in C++?,"Dynamic memory allocation & de-allocation is the process of allocating or de-allocating a block of memory in the course of the execution of a program/ software. This is useful when the size of an array is not known before the execution of a program. 

The new operator is a unary operator used to dynamically allocate a block of memory and keep its address in a pointer variable at some point during the execution of a program. In other words, this operator is like a request for memory allocation on the heap memory (or the free store). And if sufficient memory is available, the dynamic space is initialized to the newly created variable or pointer.

What happens once we do not need the variable that we've got declared dynamically? Well, we must deallocate the space in memory occupied by means of the variable.
For this, we use the delete operator and deallocate the block of memory that was dynamically allotted with the use of the new operator. In view of that, a programmer must de-allocate a block of memory, as soon as it is not required within the program or code or it will lead to memory leaks/segmentation faults. So, we require the delete operator to avoid memory leaks (i.e. segmentation faults).

What role does dynamic memory play in C++ programming?,"Dynamic memory allocation & de-allocation is the process of allocating or de-allocating a block of memory in the course of the execution of a program/ software. This is useful when the size of an array is not known before the execution of a program. 

The new operator is a unary operator used to dynamically allocate a block of memory and keep its address in a pointer variable at some point during the execution of a program. In other words, this operator is like a request for memory allocation on the heap memory (or the free store). And if sufficient memory is available, the dynamic space is initialized to the newly created variable or pointer.

What happens once we do not need the variable that we've got declared dynamically? Well, we must deallocate the space in memory occupied by means of the variable.
For this, we use the delete operator and deallocate the block of memory that was dynamically allotted with the use of the new operator. In view of that, a programmer must de-allocate a block of memory, as soon as it is not required within the program or code or it will lead to memory leaks/segmentation faults.

What is the significance of delete in C++ programming?,"What happens once we do not need the variable that we've got declared dynamically? Well, we must deallocate the space in memory occupied by means of the variable.
For this, we use the delete operator and deallocate the block of memory that was dynamically allotted with the use of the new operator. In view of that, a programmer must de-allocate a block of memory, as soon as it is not required within the program or code or it will lead to memory leaks/segmentation faults. So, we require the delete operator to avoid memory leaks (i.e. segmentation faults).

What does -> mean in C++,"Arrow operator (->) in C++ also known as Class Member Access Operator is a combination of two different operators that is Minus operator (-) and greater than operator (>). It is used to access the public members of a class, structure, or members of a union with the help of a pointer variable.

There is a .(dot) operator in C++ that is also used to access the members of a class. But .(dot operator) accesses the member or variable directly without using the pointers whereas instead of accessing members directly the arrow operator(->) in C++ uses a pointer to access them. So the advantage of the -> operator is that it can deal with both pointer and non-pointer access but the dot(.) operator can only be used to access the members of a class.

Arrow (->) operator in C++ represents the same meaning which is done by the (*) asterisk operator and dot(.) operator. Arrow operator can be written in a different way which is using the combination of two operators *.. For example, (*s).element is the same as s->element. The brackets (parenthesis) used while using the combination of (*.) operators show that the precedence of the dot(.) operator is more than *.

Elaborate on the syntax and usage of an if/else statement.,"An if-else statement is used to execute different lines of code based on a condition being true or false. If the condition is true, the if block code is executed and if the condition is false, the else block code is executed.

if(condition):
#Executes this block if the condition is true
else:
#Executes this block if the condition is false

What is elif?,"‘Elif’ stands for ‘else if’ and is used in Python programming to test multiple conditions. It is written following an if statement in Python to check an alternative condition if the first condition is false. The code block under the elif statement will be executed only if its condition is true.

The syntax for an if statement in Python is:

if condition1:
    statement to execute if condition1 is true
elif condition2:
    statement to execute if condition2 is true
else:
    statement to execute if both conditions are false

Note: in C++, instead of using elif you would use else if. Here, if condition 1 is true, the statement present inside the if block will be executed. If condition 1 is false, then the elif condition will be checked. If the elif condition is true, the statement present inside the elif block will be executed. If both conditions are false, the statement present inside the else block will be executed.

"How to edit files on a link machine with VSCode
","First, make sure that you connect to a link machine with the SSH connection feature in VSCode. To do this, click on the icon in the left sidebar that looks like a computer screen with two arrows in a circle in the bottom right corner of the icon. Either add a connection to a link machine or use an existing connection. If the icon is not present, you most likely need to install the SSH extension in VSCode.

Once you are connected to a link machine in VSCode, navigate to the top icon on the left sidebar that looks like documents stacked on each other. Click on that icon and choose “open folder.” Enter the path of the folder you would like to open. Once you do that, all the files in that folder will appear in the left sidebar.

What is Dijkstra's Algorithm?,"Dijkstra’s algorithm is a popular algorithm for solving many single-source shortest path problems having non-negative edge weight in the graphs i.e., it is to find the shortest distance between two vertices on a graph. It was conceived by Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956.

The algorithm maintains a set of visited vertices and a set of unvisited vertices. It starts at the source vertex and iteratively selects the unvisited vertex with the smallest tentative distance from the source. It then visits the neighbors of this vertex and updates their tentative distances if a shorter path is found. This process continues until the destination vertex is reached, or all reachable vertices have been visited.

The need for Dijkstra’s algorithm arises in many applications where finding the shortest path between two points is crucial.

For example, It can be used in the routing protocols for computer networks and also used by map systems to find the shortest path between starting point and the Destination (as explained in How does Google Maps work?).

It then visits the neighbors of this vertex and updates their tentative distances if a shorter path is found. This process continues until the destination vertex is reached, or all reachable vertices have been visited.

The need for Dijkstra’s algorithm arises in many applications where finding the shortest path between two points is crucial.

For example, It can be used in the routing protocols for computer networks and also used by map systems to find the shortest path between starting point and the Destination (as explained in How does Google Maps work?).

Can you offer an explanation of Dijkstra's Algorithm?,"Dijkstra’s algorithm is a popular algorithm for solving many single-source shortest path problems having non-negative edge weight in the graphs i.e., it is to find the shortest distance between two vertices on a graph. It was conceived by Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956.

What is dynamic programming?,"Dynamic Programming is a method used in mathematics and computer science to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. By solving each subproblem only once and storing the results, it avoids redundant computations, leading to more efficient solutions for a wide range of problems. These problems are common technical interview questions so it is a good idea to study and practice solving them! Some famous dynamic programming questions include the longest increasing subsequence, knapsack, and edit distance problems.
